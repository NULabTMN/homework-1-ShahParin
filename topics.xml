        <text>AN APPALLINC CATASTROPHE
          WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERISH
          The Steamboat General Slocum Bearing Sixteen Hundred Sunday School Ex
          cursionists Burns in Long Island Sound-Between Two and Three Hun
          dred Lives Were Lost-Origin of the Fire Is a Mystery-The
          Flames Started Among the Life Preservers.
          NEW YORK, June 15.—The steam
          boat General Slocum is ashore off to
          the north of Brothers&amp;apos; island, 138 th
          street. Telephone messages say that
          many persons have lost their lives.
          The vessel took fire and the pilot steer
          ed for shore, but before the ship was
          beached the flames spread from stem
          to 3tern. The Slocum carried an ex
          cursion party of 1600. half of whom
          were children. Many jumped over
          board and were drowned, while others
          were burned to death on the boat.
          The telephone operator at Brothers&amp;apos; is
          land states that the water near the is
          land is full of dead bodies. Slocum is
          an immense triple decker plying be
          tween Xew York and the Rockaway
          beach. It is now reported that 500
          lives were lost.
          The Slocum left the foot of East
          Third street for Locust grove at U
          o&amp;apos;clock this morning, being engaged by
          the Sunday school classes of St. Mark&amp;apos;s
          Lutheran church on Sixth street, be
          tween Second and the Bowery. The
          Knickerbocker Steamboat company,
          owners of the Slocum. have received
          a message stating that tiie boat has
          burned to the water&amp;apos;s edge and that
          the hulk is still burning. Their mes
          sage says that a number of persons
          jumped overboard and that some were
          picked up by small boats. Xo estimate
          of the loss of life is given by the com
          pany. The police have recovered
          eleven bodies thus far. The adults are
          mostly women. Ambulances anil sur
          geons .have been sent to the scene.
          At noon the best estimate placed on
          the number of lives lost is between
          200 and 300. About 5&amp;quot; bodies had been
          recovered at that time and the police
          tug boats. Steamers and small boats
          were out in the sound looking for the
          others. A dozen ambulances, a score
          of physicians and nurses and all the
          police reserves of the city were on the
          scene to rescue the bodies of the dead
          and succor the living and injured.
          It was an annual Sunday school ex
          cursion. The party was made up
          largely of women and children who
          commenced boarding the steamer at
          the foot of East Third street at 7 this
          morning. With the triple decks well
          filled Captain Vanschaick. a veteran
          navigator, gave the signal and the boat
          pulled out from the pier bound for
          Locust Grove, Long Island Sound. It
          headed up Fast river and all went
          well until the boat passed through
          Hell Gate and was nearing Brothers&amp;apos;
          island. Then the joy and merriment
          was quickly turned to panic by the
          cry of &amp;quot;fire.&amp;quot; Flames had been dis
          covered among the life preservers, but
          how and when they started none has
          yet been found who can say.
          The burning preservers were torn
          from their resting places and thrown
          overboard in the endeavor to smother
          the flames. This added greatly to the
          loss of life, as it was noticed after
          wards that the bodies recovered from
          the water had no life saving apparatus
          on.
          Captain Vanschaick, when the dread
          ful cry arose called for full speed and
          headed the vessel for the rock bound
          shores of North Brothers&amp;apos; island.
          Meantime the scenes aboard were
          frightful. The flames spread with ter
          rific rapidity and men, women and
          children were running about in wild
          fear, shrieking and in tears seeking a
          haven of safety. Mothers gathered
          their children in their arms and leaped
          into the water. Others seemed too
          dazed from the flames licking up
          everything up about them and were
          burned to death.</text>

        <text>MORE THAT SIX HUNDRED WOMEN AND CHILDREN DIE
          ON FLAMING VESSEL OR LEAP OVERBOARD TO DROWN
          NEW YORK, June 16. Six hundred persons— men, women and children— at a conservative
          estimate, met death yesterday by fire or drowning through the burning, beaching
          and sinking of the big three-decker excursion steamship General Slocum, which took Tire in
          the East River, near the. entrance to &amp;apos;Long Island Sound, while on her way to a
          Sound resort with more than 1000 excursionists, the Sunday-school pupils of St.
          Mark&amp;apos;s
          German Lutheran Church, their relatives and friends. At 1 o&amp;apos;clock this morning,
          accord
          ing to a statement issued by Coroner O&amp;apos;Gorman, 483 bodies had been recovered from
          the^destroyed vessel; found on the shores to which they had been washed, or picked up in
          the river, into which they had jumped or fallen from, the burning vessel. Tugs are

          o&amp;apos;clock .this moraine Coroner Darling

          East River, though the Knickerbocker
          Steamship Company, which owns the\
          Slocum, officially states that the num
          ber of passengers was 837,&amp;apos; that, being
          only one-third of the vessel&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;capacity.
          It is thought, however, that there were
          several hundred- children Jn; arms, &amp;apos;for
          whom fares are not, usually, charged
          on these trips, on board. t
          At the extreme eastern end; of Ran
          dalls Island, off: One Hundred and
          Thirty-fifth&amp;apos; street.. there is a stretch of
          water known as the Sunken Meadows^
          At this point the General Slocum took
          fire and, as the age; of .the .vessels-she
          was built in 1891— had aided In the sea-;
          soning of the wood, with which she was
          almost entirely built, she &amp;apos;was /soon a
          mass of flames. i t
          The fire; is said -to have broken out
          in the luncheon-room on th&amp;apos;e; forward
          deck, through the overturning &amp;quot;of -a,, pot
          of grease. The wind was high and all
          efforts to subdue the. flames .were futile.&amp;quot;

          NEW YORK, June 15.— James Collins,
          a special policeman, together with Po
          liceman Herbert Farrell and Olaf Jan-
          Ben, mate of the schooner E. A. Bay
          liss, were the first men to reach the
          Slocum after she was beached. They
          rowed out and took twenty-two&amp;apos; living
          persons from the ship, besides picking
          up sixteen bodies. Most of those res
          cued were clinging to the paddles of
          the Slocum, and three of the women
          were dead with their hands still
          clenched on the buckets of the wheel.
          Collins said:
          &amp;quot;I heard the terrible screaming out
          in the stream. I looked up and saw the
          Slocum blazing and persons dropping
          into the water. With Farrell and Jan
          eon I Jumped Into the yawl and rowed
          after the burning ship as fast as possi
          ble. Tugboats were then following her,
          but the heat was so great they could
          not get near her. When she beached
          we pulled toward her, but as we came
          nearer the heat singed our hair. We
          threw our coats over our. heads and
          pulled toward the roaring fire. Present
          ly we found ourselves well up under the
          sides of the ship.
          &amp;quot;When I pulled the coat off my head
          a terrible sight was before me. There,
          clinging to the paddles of the great
          wheel, were, It seemed to me, one hun
          dred women and children and a few
          men. As we came nearer they cried to
          us frantically to save&amp;apos; them. Every sec
          ond or two one of them would drop
          Into the water and sink. We went
          alongside, and by keeping away a few
          feet managed to drag fourteen into the
          boat.
          &amp;apos;Hang on,&amp;apos; we cried, &amp;apos;till we come
          back.&amp;apos; But when we started to row
          away others gave up and dropped into
          the water. We landed our&amp;quot; first load
          on a scow and went back twice more,
          taking oft twenty-two.
          &amp;quot;I noticed three large women who
          seemed to be quieter than the others,
          and we finally, dragged them into the
          boat and found they were dead, but
          still clinging to the paddles. Their heads
          were partly under water.
          &amp;quot;Several times we were nearly
          swamped by women and children grab
          bing the boat. We had to push back
          those we could not save. I believe there
          were more bodies went to the bottom
          than were recovered. Most of these
          never will be found.&amp;quot;
          NEW YORK, June 15.— One of the
          most appalling disasters in the history
          of New York, tragic in us Immensity,
          dramatic I in its episodes and deeply
          pathetic In the tender age of most of
          its, victims, took place&amp;apos; to-day in the
          East River, at the entrance to Long
          Island Sound, within a short distance
          of the New York shore and within
          sight of thousands of persons, the ma
          jority of whom were powerless to
          minimize the extent of the catastrophe.
          By the burning to the water&amp;apos;s edge
          of the Gei.aral Slocum, a three-decked
          excursion steamship, the largest in
          these waters, more than 600 persons,
          the majority of whom were women and
          children, were burned to death or
          drowned by Jumping overboard or by
          being thrown into the whirlpools by
          the lurching of the vessel and the
          frantic rush of the panic-stricken pas
          sengers.
          Approximately 485 bodies have been
          recovered and are now being tagged
          at the morgues of Bellevue Hospital
          and Harlem.
          Divers were still busy at a late hour
          taking bodies from the hold of the
          vessel, which, they say, is choked with
          thQ remains of human bodies, while
          the bodies of scores who leaped or were
          thrown j Into- the river have not been
          recovered.

          tered, to carry the excursionists to Lo
          cust Grove, one of the many resorts
          of Long Island Sound. It Is variously
          estimated that there were between 1000
          ,and 1500. persons on board the Slocum
          when she left the pier at Third street.

        <text>SEARCHING FOR BODIES IX THE WRECK OF THE SLOCUM HORROR IN EAST \l\X\iß Possibly Seven
          Hundred Lives Lost by Burning of the General Slocum. SUNDAY SCHOOL IX WILD PANIC. The
          greatest steamboat disaster ever known in this city was the burning of the General Slocum
          near North Brother Island yesterday morning. Of more than one thousand persons, whom the
          steamboat was carrying on a Sunday school excursion of the St. Mark&amp;apos;s Lutheran
          Church, of Slxth-st., Manhattan, to Locust Grove, Long Island, only a few hundred were
          saved. It was estimated, unofficially, last night that more than seven hundred perished,
          either by burnint or drowning. They were mostly women and children. Flames on the boat
          started in a room on the forward part of the freight deck about jotBL, when the General
          Slocum was passing the Sunken Meadows, and spread with great rapidity, engulfing the main
          deck and the hurricane deck. Captain Van Schaick ran the boat two miles to the north shore
          of North Brother Island, where he made an attempt to beach her. Mary of the people of the
          steamboat went overboard on the run to North Brother Island. Hundreds of women and
          children on the upper decks became insane with terror, having to choose between death by
          the rapidly advancing flames and almost equally certain death by jumping overboard. In the
          rush toward the stern of the boat the frantic people forced others against the railings
          and stanchions cf the decks with such violence as to break them down, crowding many
          overboard. Before the shore of North Brother Island was reached hundreds had dropped from
          the decks, and when the boat grounded nearly fifty feet frcm land hundreds moie threw them
          selves off the decks. The rest of the people were burned to death on the steamboat. Heroic
          work of rescue was performed by nurses and helpers on North Brother Island sad by persons
          in half a dozen boats that got near the steamer while she was blazing at the shore, and
          about three hundred people were saved and sent to hospitals. Before the General Slocum
          burned to the water&amp;apos;s edge she drifted away from the North Brother Island shore
          and sank opposite Hunt&amp;apos;s Point. Before her decks were covered with water many
          burned corpses were in view. Bodies were being recovered from the water near North Brother
          Island rapidly all the afternoon. At 6 p. m. more than three hundred bodies had been
          carried out of the water and stretched on the lawns. After being tagged for identification
          by the coroners, one hun dred and thirty of the bodies were sent to the Morgue at
          Twenty-sixth-st. Some bodies •ere carried from the wreck of the steamboat to
          Riker&amp;apos;s Island, and thirty-seven bodies which bad been taken to Manhattan earlier
          were at the police station in Alexander-aye. at One-hundred-and-thiity-eighTh-s&amp;apos;.
          At i o&amp;apos;clock this morning there were four hundred and seventy-six bodies at North
          Brother Island and two hundred and sixty-three at the city Morgue, making a total of •even
          hundred and thirty-nine. WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION Or HUMAN LIFE. The exrlft and terrible

          to the excursion were taken up. As more than one child had been admitted on a single
          ticket, however. In many case?, there were known to be more than 1.000 members of the
          excursion aboard. There were In addition twenty-three members of the crew, about a dozen
          waiters and some musicians. Captain William H. Van Rchalck. an experi enced and oldtime
          excursion boat commander, was in command of the General Slocum. The steamboat stopped at
          Twenty-third-st. at !t a. m. long enough to take aboard a few more passengers. Moist of

            h.-tve been noticed as the vessel was passing
            the Sunken Meadows, off One-hundr»d-and
            t wenty aacond-at.
            THEORIES AS TO oniG.X.
            Accounts differ as to Just where the flre
            &amp;quot;tart&amp;quot;&amp;apos; !, some declaring It had its origin In the
            forces. on the main deck, while others, the
            latter being In ih n majority, say It started In
            the boiler room almost amidships. The origin
            of the also a matter of uncertainty, it
            v;,&lt;; n.i several men who were passengers
            on the beet that careless bootblack left some
            oily :ags near a vessel filled with benzine or
            oil. whether In the forecastle or boiler room
            the) could not say, a l that spontaneous com
            bustion started the blaze that had men disas
            trous results. Still another version was that
            pan of grease boiled over in kitchen of
            lunchroom on the forward pan of the freight
            deck and started the blase.
            The flames spread with great rapidity. Some
            of ihe .-ren- s;udisaster thai they
            tried tn gel water on the (lames, n-l found th.it
            the pumps would not work. Some of the sur
            vivors saj thai the crew became demoralised
            from the start, and did little except save them
            selves. The panic spread as fasi as the flames.
            Captain Van Schaick was In the pilol house
            with Edward L. Van Wart, the pilot. He saj i
            that its soon as he was apprised of the fa&lt;
            that
            the
            boat

            gave the signal to
            the crew to report, to quarters and Bghl the
            flames. The captain at first though) he mighl
            beach his vessel on the Sunk.!. Meadows, where
            the 111-fated Seawanhaka was destroyed by tlr.&amp;apos;
            In 1880. He found, however, he says, thai the
            wind was blowing In a direction that would
            cause the fire to spread more r, U irkly If he at
            tempted to reach the Meadows. He therefore
            signalled the engineer to put on all steam, while
            he headed the burning boat for .\orth Brother
            Island, the nearest available place for running
            her ashore.
            The speed of the boal fanned the name?, send

            of smoke almost shut the upper .le, ks from view.
            Hundreds of women and children on those decks
            began to rush toward the stern* of the boat
            They became insane with terror as the panic
            increased. The crush force.! many helpless peo
            ple against the railings r,f the decks with such
            force that the stanchions were broken and tl&gt;* railings were swept
          away. SWEPT INTO THF: WATER. Then from the decks hundreds of women and Children were swept
          into the water, some falling on one another and sinking together to drown before any help
          could reach them. Captain Van Bchaick was keeping the whistle of the general rflocum going
          to attract the attention of other boats, and several boats within sight started toward her
          at full speed. In the race some of the boats picked up people In fhe water. In the race
          for the burning steamer people on the tugboat Easy Times saw two other boats decline
          assistance. Captain Churchill says he saw the ferryboat Bronx stop on her run to North
          Beach long enough to allow the General Slocum to pass her bow. and then continue on her
          trip without attempting to save any of the people wbo were falling overboard from the
          steamboat. The ferryboat people, however, deny this. A private yacht, the name of which
          was not discerned, drew out of the waj of tba THE SLOCUM AND OTHER DISASTERS Loss of Life

          approached as near the biasing steamboat as was possible and respicked out of th-^ water
          .-•.fter they had dropped over the side of the General Slocum. The Franklin Bdaon went up

          went aground OSI some rocks nearly one hundred fed from the shore of North Brother Island.
          As sho struck the rocks her hurricane deck, on which niiiny of the panic stricken women
          and children were clltici-isr, sud denly caved ir. precipitating Its human freight either
          into the blazing hold or into the water. The water around the flaming vessel was thick
          with drowning people, and. notwithstanding the almost superhuman efforts made by the res
          cuers, a large number of the perishing people had to be left to Ihelr fate. Many of those
          who jumped into the water or were precipitated over the side of the vessel when the
          hurricane deck collapsed were on flre from head t.« foot, and they escaped one form of
          death only to meet another more merciful. A man who is serving a two months&amp;apos; term on

          join in the work of rescue. Several of the women nurses helped save lives by running
          ladders down into the water from stone pier. Many acts of bravery and self-sacrifice were
          recorded. One girl, scarcely more than a child, reamed a baby. The heroine was Louise

          SPECTACLE OFHORRQ
          Hundreds of
          ed Alive
          BOAT&amp;apos;S OFFICERS UNDER ARREST
          New York, Juno 1G. Not less than
          700 Hvoa wore lost in the terrible dis
          aster which followed tho flro on board
          tho oxcurslon steamer Genornl Slo
          cum yesterday and which totally de
          stroyed that vessel.
          This Is a conservative estimate made
          after a personal inspection of tho
          morgues and pollco stations, all ot
          which at an early hour this morning
          are still surrounded by a weeping mul
          titude of porsona who havo lost loved
          ones. Up to 2 o&amp;apos;clock this morninj
          four hundrod and nlncty-olght bodies
          had been recoverod of which but one
          hundred and threo had boon identified.
          Four hundred others aro on tho miss
          ing list but thero is reason to believe
          ttiat some of tho latter will eventually
          bo found alive.
          It will bon difllcult task to identify
          all the (Toad. Some aro burned, oth
          ers aro manglod nnd bruised by fall
          ing timbers and flying machinery, and
          still others so disfigured by exposure
          to water and sun that thoy &amp;apos;possess
          but scant resemblance to the porions
          when alive. Such difllcult recognition
          means that many of tho missing will
          never bo found and that many must
          necessarily fill unknown graves.
          It&amp;quot; was a spectacle of horror beyond
          human ability to describe the do-
          structlon of a massive excursion
          stealer on which hundreds of ho&amp;apos;p
          less screaming humans wero roasted
          alive or swept Into tho waters to
          drown and tho pity of it all is that tho
          holocaust might havo been prevonted
          had ordinary precautions boon ob
          served. Ugly stories of llfo bolts
          placed out of reach and without llio
          buoyancy demanded by law; of an un
          disciplined crow that desortod its post
          of duty and saved its several lives at
          tho expenso of tho unfortunates en
          trusted to its caro; of flro apparatus
          that was worse than useless, and final
          ly of tho captain&amp;apos;s mistake in not
          heading for the noarest land arc cur
          rent everywhere but tho responsibil
          ity will not bo finally fixed for somo
          days and It is at present impossible
          to say just who shall shoulder tho
          blame.
          Tho captain and his two pilots are
          under arrest, nominally charged with
          criminal negligence, but they nssert
          that they wero not to blamo, thnt they
          did everything thoy could to savo life
          and that they owe thoir own Uvea
          simply to tho fact that they woie able
          to nwlm ashoro after thoy had beach
          ed th boat,&amp;quot; They will answer for
          any negligence, if negligence thero
          was, but .this fact will bring but poor
          comfort to those who lost lovod onoa
          by tho disaster.
          The Itov. Mr, Haas, tho pastor of
          St, Mark&amp;apos;s German Luthoran church,

          eial Slocum, it appears tonight, was
          responsible for tho marine disaster
          which wlpod out of oxistenco scores
          of women and children and plunged
          Into deopest mourning hundreds ot
          cast sido families. A trifling flrd,
          which a quick application of water
          would probably havo snuffed out at Its
          Inception was permitted to get bo
          yond control by a frightened corps
          who dashod pell mell for the rail of
          tho steamer when a pailful of fat
          boiled over on tho stovo and sot Are
          to tho woodwork. Within a fow min
          utes tho flames had spread through
          the forward part of tho crowded boat
          and wore beyond human control and
          when tho big stoamor was finally
          beached off North Brother island, she
          was a total wreck. Three quarters
          of her human, frolght had lost their
          lives elthor by flro or drowning.
          In Its sudden, paralyzing horror tho
          tragedy has
          NO PARALLEL
          In the marlno annals of Now York
          harbor. Within tho short spaco of a
          half hour, a laughing, care-free crowd,
          bound for n day&amp;apos;s outing in tho coun
          try was more than decimated by flro
          and water.
          For weeks tho congregation of tho
          St. Mark&amp;apos;s Gorman Luthoran church,
          located in East Sixth street, borough
          of Manhattan, had been looking for
          ward&amp;apos; to the &amp;quot;event of tho summer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
          in tho affairs of tho church tho an
          nual oxcurslon of tho Sunday school.
          Tho bjg passenger steamor Goneral
          Slocum had been engagod to carry
          tho scholars and their friends to Lo&amp;apos;
          cust grove, a pleasure resort on Long
          Island sound, and today had been fixed
          as tho dato for tho outing.
          Early this morning tho children nnd
          thoir mothers, with hero and there
          a male member of tho family, began
          to put In an appearance at tho pier
          of tho Knickerbocker Steamship com
          pany at East Sixth street and the East
          rlvor where tho Slocum was tied up
          awalt(ng thorn. Party aftor party
          came, but all wero warmly grootod
          as tho big craft is licensed to carry
          2,500 PASSENGERS
          and thero was llttlo fear of dangorous
          overcrowding. Nino o&amp;apos;clock was tho
          hour fixed for starting but It was fif
          teen minutes later boforo nil wero
          on board and Pilot Edward Van Wart
          gave tho signal to tho onglno room to
          &amp;quot;steam ahead.&amp;quot;
          Tho men stationed at tho gangways
          roportod to the, pastor of tho church,
          tho Rev. G. F. O. Hass, who was In
          charge, that thoy had collected 982
          tickets from adults. No account was
          taken of tho children, as when accom
          panied by elthor parent or adult com
          panion they wore pormlttod to go on
          board without a ticket. .Captain Wil
          liam H. Van Schalck and the steam
          boat inspector who was stationed to
          prevent overcrowding estimated that
          thero wero fully
          SIXTEEN HUNDRED SOULS
          on board whon tho hawsers wero cast
          off.
          Stationed on tho main deck, aft, was
          a largo band which played lively mu
          sic as the big steamer slowly drove
          her noso through tho wntors of tho
          East river, hoadod for Long Island,
          sound. Chlldron Bwarmod over tho
          suporstructuro of tho boat, romping
          happily and playing tho gamos dear
          to childhood hearts. Their elders se
          cured good seats out of tho sun nnd
          prepared to enjoy tho threo hours&amp;apos;
          sail to tho grove. As tho big steamer
          sailed majestically up tho rlvor sho

          Tho pastor of tho church and his
          assistants, who had beon vory buBy
          slnco an early hour, passod forward
          Into tho dining saloon to sccuro urcak
          fast. Suddenly thoro was obsorvod a
          PUFF OF FLAME
          from tho kitchen, caubed, It was after
          wards learned, by a pot of grease boil
          ing over on tho cooking apparatus. Tho
          Inmates of tho kitchen ran madly In
          to tho open and almost instnntly, tho
          blao spread to the woodwork of tho
          kitchen and from thoro to tho iorward
          end of tho steamer.
          Tho comparatively fow people In tho
          bow rushed madly toward tho rear
          SCREAMING &amp;quot;FIRE&amp;quot;
          at tho top of their voices. Imme
          diately an Indescribable panic seem
          ed to Boize upon tho hundreds of peo
          ple, who, lazily resting on camp stools
          and chairs, a momont before had been
          Idly watching tho passing panorama
          along tho rlvor front. A hurried
          learch for llfo prosoivers was thon
          begun by many on board but most of
          theso wero packed away under tho
          cabin scats and In other places difll
          cult to got at In tho confusion.
          In tho moantlmo tho members of tho
          crow who had retained thoir heads
          began an attempt to put out tho flro
          or at least to get It under control until
          help arrlvod. Their efforts wore, how
          evor, in vain. The flames, fanned b
          a brisk south breeze, found ready food
          In tho light, wooden suporstructuro
          stretching in two platforms abovo tho
          hull. Choking, denso smoko began to
          pour thiough tho companlonways,
          flooding tho bow of tho boat with stif
          ling vapor and driving everybody aft
          whoro they gathered in
          A HELPLESS MASS.
          At this time tho steamer was off a
          point about opposite Ono Hundred and
          Twenty Eighth streot and it soomod
          as though she could bo run closo
          onough In-shoro to pormit her living
          freight to bo rescuod, Why Captain
          Van Schalck.dld not do this still
          REMAIN A MYSTERY,
          although ho himself declares that ho
          was afraid to tako a chance on dock
          ing his boat noar tho lumber yards
          and oil soaked wharves which lino the
          rlvor at this point. Bo that as it may,
          tho fact romatns&amp;apos;that for fully fifteen
          minutes the steamer was driven at
          &amp;quot;full spcod ahoad&amp;quot; in tho teeth of a
          ten knot breoze which swept tho flro
          back on tho helpless women and chil
          dren in tho stern, and, whon tho Slo
          cum&amp;apos;s head wbb Anally turned shoro
          ward, it was only to land her on tho
          Inhospitable rocks of North Drother
          island whoro but llttlo help was avail
          able. Women went
          LITERALLY INSANE
          at onco. Som had pormlttod thoir
          little charges to liocomo separated
          from thorn and In that frantic mob
          thoro was llttlo chanco for rounlon.
          Men, maddenod by foar, trod roughly
          over fainting women and chlldron,
          knocking down any who resisted thorn,
          in a frantic effort to reach tho sido
          that thoy might leap overboard Into
          tho cool wator. To most of tho ter
          rorized multltudo it wna but n choica
          of deaths that was offorod. To stay
          on board meant tho awful certainty of
          bolng
          DURNED ALIVE.
          To tako lo tho water meant for all
          but a fow tlio certainty of drowning.
          A)l tho way for the half mllo that
          tho blazing Goucral Slocum steamed
          for North Drother island shoro, ob
          servers wore mado frantlo by tho pit
          iable sight which that flaming &amp;apos;mass
          presented. Men and women, with
          hero nnd thoro a child of tender years
          could bo scon clinging llko flics to
          tho edgo of tho rail and to tho big,
          snako-Uke hawsers that lined the sides
          and to which Avero attached tho fen
          der guards. Ono by ono and thou by
          twos nnd threes and finally half a doz
          en at n tlmo, they dropped off ns
          strength gavo out or hope died. Those
          who could swim preferred tho desper
          nto possibility of keeping afloat. Most
          heart-rending sight of nil was to see
          tho babies nnd small children
          THROWN OVERHOARD
          by thoso who had them in their caro.
          Just as tho steamer grounded, tho
          liurrlcnno deck fell In. A great burst
          of flame, smoko and sparks went up,
          and tho vessel In an instant was aflro
          from stem to atom and from water&amp;apos;s
          edgo to tho tip of tho pilot house. In
          tho seething pit which her hull had bo
          como, wero entombed no ono know
          how many of tho unfortunates who
          had found instoad a
          TERRIBLE DEATH.
          It was oxactly twenty-five minutes
          uftor twelve o&amp;apos;clock, somo two hours
          after tho Slocum had caught flro that
          her flamo shattered hull broke and
          bank Into tho waters from tho rocks
          on which sho had been beached. In
          to that short time had been crowded
          experiences which had maddened
          many, and turned dark hair white, and
          which will never be forgotten by those
          who witnessed them, and survived. A
          description of tho scones becomes a
          record of details many of which aro
          heroic beyond description, tho others
          of
          SO SAD A NATURE
          as to becloud tho recollection.
          Tho big ocean-going tugboat Massa
          soit was bound through Hell Gat at
          tho time of tho disaster. Sho was
          within hailing dlstnnco when the at
          tention of her crew was attracted by
          tho llio and panic on tho larger craft.
          Tho Massasolt&amp;apos;s captain, without an
          Instant&amp;apos;s hesitation, put to the aid ot
          the distressed vessel and to his pres
          enco of mind many owo their lives.
          Running so close as possible to tho
          blazing craft, tho crow of tho Massa
          soit pulled all that could bo reached
          aboard their own vessol with boat
          hooks while nt tho samo tlmp every
          llfo preserver aboard was thrown to
          persona
          STRUGGLING IN THE WATER.
          FInnlly with forty-flvo terribly burned
          persons strotched on her deck, the
          Mnssasolt stoored for tho shoro whoro
          thoso lescued wero put on tho docks
          and medical help summoned. Tho
          Massasolt then mado for North Broth
          or Island whoro tho Slocum wns beach
          ed, and rescued many- others.
          On tho Island Is the Now York City
          hospital for tuberculosis, among oth
          ers. As tho Slocum approached tho
          beach, Miss Florcnco Donning, a
          nurso, who was standing on tho oast
          shoro, saw what was tho matter and
          RAISED AN ALARM.
          Then, without an Instant&amp;apos;s hesitation,
          sho plunged Into tho water and was
          followed almost Immediately by Drs.
          Lord, Wiseman, Horowitz, Cannon,
          Algeson and Watson and soveral male
          nurses. Thoy caught many children
          and asslstod thoni nshoro and bofort.
          they stoppod their heroic work, ex
          hausted, sixty lives had been saved.
          Tho crow of tho steamer throw out a
          gangplank and a number managed to
          gain tho shoro over It. Hundreds of
          others, however, had sank down, ovor
          comc, olthor by flro or smoko and their
          rescue was impossible.
          When tho Slocum sank It was esti
          mated that nearly
          200 CHARRED BODIES
          woio in sight in her smoking hull and
          somo of theso floated Into tho rlvor
          whero thoy wero picked up by pass
          ing boats. Somo idea of tho intensity
          of tho flames may bo gathered from
          tho fact the tug Fldollty picked up
          olghty-elght charred bodies with heads
          and limbs but cinder-like masses and
          ovory stitch of clothing burned away.
          Nono of thoso bodlos can over bo iden

          Before the Slocum had struck tho
          rocks of North Brothor Island the
          news of tho disaster had sproad llko
          lightning along both shores of tho
          rlvor and crafts of ovory description
          wero headed for tho sceno. Many sur

          One of The Most Appalling Disas
          ters in The History of
          New York.
          New York.June 15.-One of the most
          appalling disasters in the hstory of
          New York. fragic in its immensity,
          dramatic in its episodes and deeply
          pathetic in&amp;apos;the tender age of most of
          its victims, took place today in the
          East River, at the entrance to Long
          Island Sound, wihin a short distance
          of the New York shore, within sight
          of thousands of persons, the majority
          oft whom were powerless to minimize
          the extent of the catastrophe.
          By the burning to the water&amp;apos;s edge
          of the General Slocum, three-decked
          excursion steamer, the largest in
          these waters, six hundred persons,
          the majority of whom were women
          and children, were burned to death or
          drowned by jumping overboard or by
          being thrown into the whirlpools by
          the lurching. of the vessel and the
          frantic rush of the panic-stricken pas
          sengers.
          It is the season of Sunday-school
          excursions in New York Bay and
          Long Island Sound, the latter one of
          the mcst picturesque bodies of water
          in the country.
          Great preparation had been made
          for the seventeenth annual excursion
          of the Sunday-school of St. Mark&amp;apos;s
          German Lutheran church, the congre
          gation of which is drawn from the
          dense population of the lower East
          and West sider. and the General Slo
          cum had been chartered to carry the
          excursionists to Locust Grove, one of
          the many resorts on Long Island
          Sound.
          The number of excursionists on
          board today is variously estimated at
          from 1.500 to 2.5oo. but according to
          an official statement issued by the
          Knickerbocker Steamboat company,
          owners of the Slocum. the number of
          passengers was 873, that being one
          third of the vessels licensed capacity.
          The fire broke out in a lunch room
          on the forward deck. The blaze was
          caused by the overturning of a pot
          of grease.
          The excursionists, but a few mo
          ments before in the full enjoyment of
          an ideal summer&amp;apos;s day on Long Is
          land Sound. were driven to the after
          part of the steamer to escape the heat
          flames and smoke that were constant
          ly increasing. Policemen and deck
          hands aboard the boat struggled hard
          to quiet the panic, but their efforts
          were in vain. The wild disorder in
          creased. as frantic mothers sought
          their children, who had been at play
          about the decks.
          The steamer&amp;apos;s whistle was blowing
          for assistance and tugs and other
          nearby craft answered to the call.
          Before any of the boats could reach
          the burning steamer, however. the
          frantic women and children began to~
          jump overboard. The current was
          strong and there are many whirlpools
          in the channel. The boats that always
          abound in the vicinity picked many
          persons from the water. but these
          were only a small number of those
          that were seen struggling in the swift
          current.
          These small boats rescued all those&amp;apos;I
          in the water whom they could reach.,
          but many persons struggled and sank
          before any help could reach them. In
          the wake of the Slocum as she hurried
          up stream was a line of little black
          spots, marking the heads and bodies
          of those who had sought to escape the
          roaring furnace on the ship by throw
          ing themselves overboard.
          The Slocum got within fifty feet of
          the nofthwest point of North Broth
          ers Island asnd there stopped in the
          .h allow water.
          A Day of Gloora Yesterday.
          New York, June 16.--About two
          hundred and fifty yards from the New
          York shoe. off the place knowvn as
          Hunt&amp;apos;s Point. the upper part of a pad
          die box. two smoke stacks, a flagstaff.
          and twisted. bent iron work lie, the
          remnants of the ill-fated steamboat
          General Slocum.
          It is a temporary and hideous
          monument of the scene where nearly
          a thousand persons. most of whom
          were women and children. lost their
          lives in fire and water.
          Today therF are grave murmurings
          and charges that the horrible sacri
          fce of life was needless. and that the
          officers of the boat, though brave. ad
          mittedly erred when they drove the
          vessel a half mile before beaching
          her.
          There is also the charge that the
          life belts were rotten and unservice
          able and that the construction of the
          upper works of the boat was faulty,
          inasmuch as they were all of wood so
          as to give free sweep to the flames.
          Today all is gloom and the people
          refuse to be comforted, for five hun
          dred homes have been visited by the
          Angel of Death, while as many others
          contained loved ones burned&amp;apos;and oth
          erwise injured.
          Crepe. some white and &amp;apos;some black,
          hangs from many doors today, and
          the death emblem is constantly being
          added to.
          539 Recovered at Noon.
          New York, June 16.-Up to noon
          today four hundred and sixty-nine
          bodies had been received at the mor
          gue, and seventy more were on their
          way there aboard the city tug
          &amp;quot;Fidelity.&amp;quot;
          This brings the list of recovered
          dead up to 539.
          There have been i65 identifications
          up to the noon hour, and permits for
          tre removal of these bodies have been
          granted.
          Early Yesterday Morning.
          New York. June 16.-Up to 8.3c
          o&amp;apos;clock this morning four hundred
          and eighty-nine bodies of victims of
          the disaster on the steamboat Gen
          eral Slocum had been recovered. Eight
          bodies in one group were picked up
          on North Brothers island.
          The divers at dawn resumed their
          work in the sunken hold.
          They have by their efforts added
          to the ghastly horror, which steadily
          grew during the night.
          The total number of dead, it is now
          estimated, will reach at least eight
          hundred. Some estimate that the list
          will go as high as one thotisand.
          Grief-stricken crowds thronged the
          morgue and the vicinity of St. Mark&amp;apos;s
          church and the shores near the wreck
          all night last night looking for loved
          ones.
          One mother who indentified the
          burned body of her child at the mor
          gue this morning tried to jump from
          the pier on which the body lay.
          She was restrained with difficulty
          from uttering the serious charges
          made by the supervisor that thc
          steamboat was supplied with rotton
          life preservers.
          The authorities are investigating
          thcse charges.
          Among the bodies identified at St.
          Mark&amp;apos;s church last night was that of
          Mrs. Anna Haas, the wife of the pas
          tor of the church.
          Dr. Haas is among the rescued. He
          his wife and daughter got outside the
          rail of the Slocum before the steamer
          beached. He cannot say whether they
          jumped or fell or were pushed into the
          water. He sank and when he rose he
          found scores about him figh?ing for
          life. He failed to find his wife and
          daughter. With great effort he kept
          afloat and was about to give up in
          despair when a man on one of the
          tugs picked him up. Of the scores he
          saw about him when he rose, one by
          one sank.
          The following telegraphic message
          from President Roosevelt has been
          received by Pastor Haas:
          &amp;quot;Accept my profound smypathy for
          yourself. your church and your con
          gregation.

          New York: One of the most appalling distresses in the history
          of Now York,,.tri)gic in its immensity, dramatic in its episodes, and
          deeply pathetic in tho tender age of most of its victims, took place
          in tho East river, at the entrance of Long Island Sound, within a
          short distance of the New York shore and within sight of thousands
          of persons, the majority of whom were powerless to immunize the
          extent of tho catastrophe. By the burning to tho water&amp;apos;s edge of
          the steamer General Slocum, a three deck excursion boat, more
          than COO pesons, the majority of whom were women and children,
          were burned to deuth or were drowned by jumping overboard or by
          being thrown into the whirlpools by tho lurching of the vessel and
          tho frantic rush of the panic stricken passengers. Tho boat was
          carrying a Sunday school excursion of tho St. Marks Lutheran
          church on the annual picnic.
          NEW YORK: Six hundred per
          sons, men, women and children,
          perished by tho burning of the ex
          cursion steamer, General Slocum, near
          Hell Gate, In tho East river. The
          Slocum, with the annual Sunday
          school excursion of St. Mark&amp;apos;s Luth
          eran church of this city, on board was
          proceeding up tho river to one of
          the many resorts of Long Island.
          When near One Hundred and&amp;apos;Twenty
          fifth strcot persons on tho boat saw
          smoke and flames spring from the
          upper part of tho crowded steamer. A
          panic ensued on tho boat almost Im
          mediately. Crowds on the forward
          deck began to spring overboard or to
          rush to tho after part of the boat. The
          screams of tho terrified passengers
          could bo heard on shore, and hun
          dreds of small boats Immediately put
          off to their rescue. Owing to rocks
          on either side of tho channel at this
          point it was impossible to reach the
          vessel. Tho captain remained at his
          post at the whoel and headed tho ves
          sel straight up tho river for North
          Brother island, where she was put
          aground &amp;apos;in shallow water. Several
          hundred feet of open water still lay
          between the burning steamer and tho
          shore, and many persons perished
          cithor in tho wator or on tho burning
          vessol nftcr sho had been beached.
          It was estimotod that the steamer
          carried more than 2,000 persons. She
          was tho largest excursion steamer in
          theso waters&amp;apos; and could accommodate
          1,000 passengers.
          The steamer whistle was blowing
          for assistance as sho camo up the
          river. Several hundred persons were
          seen to jump into tho water just be
          foro sho headed for tho North Broth
          ers island. Her position in tho water
          made It impossible for thoso aboard
          to reach land except by awlmming.
          An oyo witness says ho saw fifty or
          100 persons, mostly womou and chil
          dren jumped overboard. Most of tho
          throug were on tho hurricane deck
          when that portion of it collapsed.
          Many must have lost their lives in
          tho seething &amp;apos;torrent of flamo and
          water. Tho pastor of the church, tho
          Rev. George C. Ephoss, was on board
          with all his family and It Is reported
          that they wcro lost. The boat caught
          fire in Hell Gate and tho flames had
          completo control before any move
          could be made to check tho fire.
          A frightful scene followed. It was
          Impossible to run the boat ashore be
          cause of the Hell Gate rocks on either
          side. Nothing could be done in the
          way of launching, and as the flames
          advanced the passengers began to
          jump overboard. Hundreds were In
          the river. Many were rescued by the
          tugs and other vessels, but hundreds
          perished.
          Several hundred bodies rrero
          washed ashore or towed or carried in
          boats to Brothers Island. Almost
          every other woman taken away was
          calling for her child. The disaster
          was witnessed by thousands of per
          sons on shore, and as rapidly as pos
          sible hundreds of small boats and
          launches set off to render assistance.
          With the boat burning from under
          his feet the catpain stuck to his post
          In the pilot house and the engineer
          remained at his post below until the
          boat was beached.
          Even the passengers who did not
          jump overboard were not safe, for
          they were somo distance from the
          shore, and the boat was a veritable
          furnace.
          The greatest loss of lifo was caused
          by tho collapsing of the heavy upper
          deck. It fell with a crash, crush
          ing hundreds who had gathered on
          tho lower deck. It was then the
          greatest panic ensued, amid tho living
          stream of persons going over the rail
          ing Into the water. Patients in the
          hospitals on the islands became al
          most insane from fright at the ter
          rible scenes they were compelled to
          witness. A lorge part of the crowd
          on tho steamer were little children,
          and there was little hope for them
          after they went overboard. The cur
          rent was strong and the little ones
          woro rushed to their deaths by the
          whirl pools in Hell Gate.
          At least fifty children perished in
          this manner.
          After tho rail gavo way and tho
          passengers who had crowded against
          it were pushed into the river, moth-J
          ers and children became separated
          and frantically sought each other,
          while in several cases fathers and
          mothers, gathering their children to
          gether, jumped with them into the
          water. Little children, holding each
          other by tho hand, jumped together
          and were found afterwards clasped in
          each other&amp;apos;s arms. It la allege tttt
          men fought with women to escape, re
          sulting in the trampling under foot of
          scores of children.
          The General Slocum had reached
          Sunny Meadows, at the extreme east
          of Randall&amp;apos;s Island, when the fire
          were discovered. By tho time the
          steamer reached One Hundred and
          Thirty-fifth street the excursionist!
          were driven to the rail, many of them
          with clothing on fire, and they began
          to Jump overboard by twos and threes.
          When One Hundred and Thirty-eighth
          street was reached the hurricane deck
          collapsed. Many persons were
          thrown Into the water, but hundreds
          were precipitated Into the lower deck,
          which itself was a mass of women and
          children.
          Many of the bodies recovered were
          horribly burned. It will be hours be
          fore the fire in the hold of tho vessel
          1? out, and the bodies removed there
          from. A tug of the New York Central
          saved nearly a score through the
          heroism of an unknown man. This
          man stood on the paddle wheel box of
          the Slocum and passed women and
          children to the tug until he was driv
          en back by flames He then jumped
          into the tug himself.
          Neither policemen nor firemen,
          when thte occurred waited to remove
          their coats, but jumped overboard
          and saved u great many who would
          otherwise have been drowned.
          Both firemen nnd wreckers say the
          greatest loss of life, extending into
          the hundreds, occurred in the hold.
          North Brother island, where the
          Slocum was beached, is occupied by
          municipal charity hospitals, and a con
          siderable number of physicians and
          nurses were immediately summoned.
          Bodies Drifted Ashore
          For hours the bodies of the burned
          and the drowned drifted ashore on tho
          island, and between One Hundred and
          Thirty-first street and One Hundred
          and Thirty-eighth street in Manhattan.
          Some came ashore still alive. Many
          of these died, but others will recover.
          The scene was pitiable in tho ex
          treme, as the living and dead were
          brought In. Rows of bodies were
          stretcr d along the beach. Hysterical
          women and frantic men went along
          looking at ono after another, searching
          for children and friends. Women with
          disfigured faces, their clothing par
          tially stripped from hein, were car
          ried to the improvised emergency hos
          pital, crying for children who had
          been torn from them in the mad rush
          when tho boat took fire.
          Meanwhile the Slocum burned to
          the water&amp;apos;s edge. At 12:25 o&amp;apos;clock.
          &amp;apos;two hours and twenty-five minutes
          after the fire was discovered, she sank.
          It Is estimated that there were nearly
          100 charred bodies on her decks. Just
          after the steamer sank the water near
          by was black with bodies. The tug
          Fidelity succeeded In picking up
          eighty-eight charred corpses in Hunt&amp;apos;a
          cave, off Ricker&amp;apos;s island and carried
          I: &amp;apos;in intb the sound. None of these
          bodies, it Is thought, can ever be iden
          tified. It is alleged that no attempt was
          made to get out the fire npapratus at
          tho first cry of fire, though Captain
          Van Shank says that he immediately
          rang the bells for getting out the ap
          paratus. According to several state
          ments, no attempt was made to lower
          boats or life rafts.
          North Brother Island, where the
          vessel was beached, contains a scarlet
          fever ward. The patients who wit
          nessed tho disaster were ordored In
          doors, and the doctors hastened to the
          rescue of those who had been washed
          ashore, but somo scores of persons
          died while they were being attended
          to.
          According to a statement Issued by
          Coroner O&amp;apos;Gorman, 483 bodies have
          been recovered from the destroyed
          vessel, burned to death or drowned
          and found on the shores to which they
          had been washed or picked up in the
          river to which they had Jumped or
          fallen from the burning vessel.
          Tugs are arriving hourly with bodies
          from North Brother Island.

          Commander Cameron McR. Wtaslow, a mem
          ber of the federal commission appointed to in
          vestigate the disaster, visited the wreck yester
          day, In company with Inspector General George
          Uhler and Supervising Inspector Robert S.
          Rodie. After examining the hulk and congratu
          lating Coroner o*Gorman on the latter ex
          cellent handling of the work on North Brother
          Island, Commander Window officially turned
          the wreck over to the coroner, thereby giving
          up federal authority over the hulk.
          Ex-Fire Marsha] Free!, representing the Dis
          trict Attorney, and Coroner Berry, both of whom
          were at the wreck, descended into the store
          rooni under the forward part of the main deck,
          ■where the fire is supposed to have originated.
          er.d here he found a number of oil barrels, some
          bugs of charcoal and some hay. Mr. Freel. who
          is confident that the fire started there, when
          a^Ked why th« oil barrels had not exploded or
          burned, replied that, while the flre started at
          thai place, It was then small and was swept by
          toe -iraught up through the hatchway to the
          main deck, where it gained in volume.
          There :a no framework remaining above the
          main deck, except the &amp;quot;hog frame,&amp;quot; one of the
          i^ams of which was found yesterday to be al
          most entirely rotten In a part which had been
          spliced and covered with good boards. These
          boards, skilfully painted, would have deceived
          ajiy Inspector.
          John McDougall. the United States naval
          architect, who. at the request of Commissioner
          McAdoo. has been examining the hulk of the
          Slocurj. suggested that it be towed to the Erie
          Basin, here it would be easier of access.
          In speaking of the pri\ate yacht which was
          reported to have passed the ocune when she
          was on fire, without offer of assistance. Coroner
          O&amp;apos;Oorman said:
          I know that the report true. and. moreover, I
          kr.ow wno the owner of the yueh: is. 1 will not
          ffive his uame unless necessary. Suffice it to say

          ar»r He should have lowered his club and pri
          vate pennants after refusing aid to the Slocum.

          with sad) pennar.ts to read from them who tba
          owner may be. Should the ■enUemaz desire now

          ST. MARK&amp;apos;S &amp;quot;GRANDMOTHERS&amp;quot; FUNERAL.
          Beethoven Hall, No. 431 L&gt;st Sixth-nt.. was crowded yesterday morning with people who
          at
          tended the funeral of Mrs. Sophia Schu&lt;»r?l-r.
          sixty-three years old. of No. 33S Sixth-st—
          who lost her life on the General Slccum. and
          who was kr.own as the &amp;quot;grandmother&amp;quot; of the
          St. Mark&amp;apos;s congregation. Mrs. Schueffler
          weighed about four hundred pounds, and th«
          funeral could not be held in her house, as it waa
          Impossible to get the specially built coffin into
          the building.
          After the service In the hall, which was con
          ducted by the Rev. Mr. Krueska.. twenty-one
          carriages followed the hearse pact St. Mark&amp;apos;s
          Church to the Williams burg Bridge. Nearly
          eve: y child in the neighborhood waited pa
          tiently to see the hearse and carriages pass.
          The funeral was the largest single one connected
          with th« Genera! Slocum calamity.
          It was the cu3tom of Mrs. Schueffler to take
          the five families of her two daughters and three
          sons on the annual St. Mark&amp;apos;s excursions. It
          was due to a fortunate whim of hers that she
          went alone on the excursion this year for the
          first time. She said she had grown too old and
          too stout to lake the responsibility of caring
          for so many of thoee near and dear to her, and
          so would go alone.
          It wai not known that there was any person
          within many miles of New- York who had not
          neard of the Sloi-urn disaster before yesterday,
          but those in charge of the information bureau
          at St. Mark* Church learned of one man who
          did not know that nearly one thousand persons
          had perished in the East River, and that his
          wife might be among that number. That per
          son i.-i Frederick Seelig. of Dundee Lake. Ber
          jj&lt;&amp;apos;n County. N. J. Beetlg visited a country
          store yesterday and picked up an old copy of
          a German newspaper. In it. for the first time,
          be learned of the disaster, and then hastened to
          this city to find hi* wife. For several duya
          Se«*:ig had not heard by letter from his wife.
          and wondered why this was so.
          He Inquired at the information bureau for
          her, and was informed that her name was not
          on the missing or dead l!3ts. About ten days ago
          Peelig gave his wife money enough to come to
          this city and open a delicatessen store. At the
          same time he gave her two tickers for the Slo
          rum excursion. Seelig was formerly a member
          of St. Mark&amp;apos;s Church. At the Morgue Sre.ij?
          found clippings tram his wife&amp;apos;s clothing, which
          he Identified. He was told where his wife was
          buried. He will have the body exhumed and
          buried In his own lot at the cemetery.

        <text>WHY JUSTICE WEEPS
          Capt. Wm. II. Van Schaick, who was
          in command of the steamboat General
          Slocum when that excursion boat was
          burned in the East river on June 15,
          1904, with a loss of a thousand lives,
          yesterday was paroled from Sing Sing
          by the Federal authorities and return
          ed to his home in New York.
          The captain, now In his seventy
          sixth year, was found guilty three
          years and seven months ago of neg
          lect of duty and was sentenced by
          Judge Thomas In the United States
          court to ten years at hard labor.
          Foremost in the fight to secure the
          captain&apos;s freedom has been his wife,
          who was superintendent of nurses at
          Lebanon hospital at the time of the
          burning of the General Slocum. and
          who received a certificate of honor
          from the government for her work at
          North Brother Island the day the
          burning boat was beached. The then
          Grace Mary Spratt had known Captain
          Van Schaick for a number of years
          and the captain and the superintend
          ent of nurses were married two years
          after the disaster.
          During Mrs. Van Schalck&apos;s fights to
          secure parole for her husband the so
          ciety known, as the General Slocum
          Survivors J Organization as steadily
          fought against having him liberated.

        <text>Steamboat Inspector Removed.
          Washington Oct. 18.—President
          Roosevelt has removed from office
          Robert S. Rodie, supervising inspec
          tor of the United States steamboat
          service, located at New York, on ac
          count of the disclosures of the com
          mission appointed to investigate the
          Slocum disaster. In accordance
          with Secretary Metcalf&apos;s directions,
          steps have been taken toward tha re
          moval of James A. Dumont, inspector
          of hulls, and Thomas Barrett, in
          spector of boilers, both of the port of
          New York.
          Statements of the charges made
          against them have been forwarded to
          them. They are charged with neglect
          of duty, incompentcy and inefficiensy.
          They will be required to make answer
          to the charges within a reasonable
          time. It was not known to President
          Roosevelt until late tonight that Su
          pervising Inspecting Rodie was the
          holder of a presidential office. It was
          supposed by the president when he
          wrote his letter to Secretary Metealf
          that Rodie was an appointee of the
          secretary.</text>

          Story —Lawyer Uowe
          Missing.
          By the Associated Press,
          Philadelphia, Nov. 20.—Tbe arch
          conspirator, H. H. Holmes, accompa
          nied by Mrs. Pitzel and a pretty woman
          who calls herself Mrs. Holmes, arrived
          in this city today in the custody of De
          tective Crawford and Special Agent Perry
          •of the Fidelity Mutual Life association.
          Mrs. Piizel&apos; s 16 year old daughter, Meda,
          and her 1-year-old bay were also with
          the party. Mrs. Holmes disappeared
          soon after her arrival, and no clue to her
          whereabouts could be obtained. It is
          thought she is stopping at a hotel in the
          neighborhood of police headquarters.
          After tbe arrival, tbe party was
          closeted with Superintendent of Police
          Linden until late in the afternoon.
          When the conference was over. Detective
          Crawford detailed the story of tbe trip,
          tbe moat important feature of which
          was the relation by Mr. Holmes of the
          story of bis whole life. It reads like
          tbe moat sensational of romances.
          Holmes Bat beside tbe detective with
          handcuffs on. The train had scarcely
          emerged from the Boston depot before
          lie iried to bribe hie captor. He offered
          the detective $000 if ho would allow him
          to escape. He said he had frequently
          hypnotized persons, having acquired the
          r.rt from a coliege professor in the west.
          He said he could get the money from
          his wife or Mrs. Pitzel. Wben ho caw
          his words had no effect, he entered into
          general conversation aud told the story
          of hia life.
          He said he was raised in Burlington,
          Vermont, and was co well educated in
          the schools that at 15 he was a tencher.
          For some time afterward he went to
          collegia there and later in Detroit, Micb.
          Here he formed the acquaintance of a
          medical student, who, he said, fur
          nished the body in New York in the
          present caee. He refused to divulge
          hie name. During vacations tbey wonted
          on farrae to ruiee their college expeuees.
          but one summer tbey found theuiGelves
          without means, and then the medical
          man suggested the idea of getting a
          body and beating nn insurance com
          pany. This was 12 years ago.
          The doctor got his life insured for
          $12,000. They obtained a body in Chi
          cago, took it east, arranged the details
          id identification and successfully got
          the money with which they continued j
          their studies. He refused to name the
          company thus swindled. They worked
          the scheme afterwards with sncceis,
          obtaining sums ranging from $10 000 to
          $20,000.
          j Once Holmes got bis life insured for
          $20,000 He then went to a hotel in
          Rhode Inland. At that time be wore a
          beard. He secured a corpse in Chicago,
          cut off the head and took tbo body to a
          lonely spot not far from tbe hotel.&apos; Then
          he ehaved off his beard, returned to the
          hotel, asked for Holrr.es and engaged a
          room to wait for him. He bad brought
          the head with him and burned it be
          yond recognition in the fireplace of the
          hotel. This scheme, however, fell
          through, the mother of big wife, when
          she discovered the scheme, threatening
          to tell tbe police, and Holmes fled to
          the west.
          Resuming his story he said that while
          living in Chicago about 18 months ago,
          he tell in with a type-writer girl and
          furnished a house on the outskirts
          where tbey lived together. A younger
          sister came to visit them and the
          woman grew so jealous of her that in a
          quarrel one day she struck her over
          the head with a etool and killed her.
          To save the woman with whom he
          lived, Holmes said he put the body in
          a trunk loaded with stones and sunk
          it in the lake.
          This girl had property in Texas, and
          he and Pitzel took it off her hands and
          sent her abroad. It waa worth, he said,
          $40,000, and after getting it in their
          hands they went through Texas buying
          carloads of horses on notes on this prop
          erty, but as they never had a legal title
          to the property, the notes were worth
          less, and it is for this affair they are
          wanted in Fort Worth. To save this
          property Holmes said he and Pitzel
          formed tbo scheme of swindling the Fi
          delity company. He told the detective
          that for the crimes he had committed
          he deßerved to be hanged a dozen
          times.
          Holmes is not lacking for money, as
          he himself admitted that at the present
          time he ih supporting nearly two dozen
          persons, including the girl murderess,
          her mother and an imbecile brother,
          two orphans in Chicago who live in one
          of his properties, three separate alleged
          wiveß and their children rtnd his own
          mother and father in Kankakee. He
          would not give the names of the women.
          He firmly maintained that Pitzel ie
          alive and in Snn Salvador, and that he
          will hear from him through the personal
          column of a certain newepaper,
          Mr. Ferry said that ac a result of the
          interview it had been decided to arrest
          a number of other persona whose names
          were not ready to be given out.
          Mr. Perry related in detail the story
          of Holmes&apos; arrest in Boston and the
          manner in which Mrs. Pitzel was de
          coyed from Burlington. He said tbat in
          the secret conference today nothing had
          been said that would in tbe slightest
          degree refute his original theory that
          Pitzel had been murdered. Wben in
          the west be saw tbe parents of Mrs.
          Pitzel, and tbey told him their daugh
          ter had complained of the exorbitant
          fee charged by the St. Loniß lawyer—
          $2500. In corroboration of his murder
          theory, Mr. Perry said tbat he had from
          Mrs. Pitzel an exact description of
          her husband, agreeing in every respect
          with that of the corpse found in the
          Oallowhill street hoose. Mrs, Pitzel, he
          continued, was perfectly innocent of
          any complicity in the whole affair. She
          told Perry last night that she had re
          ceived only $5000 in cash. She said
          Holmeß had taken $5000 of the money
          and put it in a speculation in Port
          Worth in which Pitz9l was also Inter
          ested. Holmes told Perry that this was
          true. In Texas, Perry said, Holmes
          operated under the name of H. H.
          Pratt. He added that Pitzel and B. T.
          Lyman are one and tbe same man.
          MRS. PITZEL&apos;S STORY.
          Hho Fairs Bar Hmliiud Is Really Dead.
          M-r Daughter Missing.
          Boston. Nov. 20.—Mrs. Carrie Pitiel,
          it is claimed, has made a full confession
          of the alleged insurance swindle. It is
          stated that she hae implicated Holmeß,
          at whose suggestion, it is claimed, she
          went to Burlington, Vt. She stated
          that Holmee substituted tbe alleged
          bogus body for that of her husband and
          collected the insurance, but she was
          kept in ignorance of the whereabouts
          of her husband, who disappeared at
          once. Since the affair she has been
          roaming round from place to place,
          prompted by Holmee, in eearcti of her
          hueband, and it waa through the hope
          that she would be sent to him that Bhe
          answered the telegrams of the detec
          tives. Now ahe fears that the body for
          which the insurance was paid was not a
          bogus one, but that of her hnsband.
          Mrs. Pitzel aleo fears that her daugh
          ter, Alice, who was the only one besides
          Holmes t identify tha body, has been
          spirited away, as Bhe has completely
          disappeared and Holmes is the last one
          known to have seen her. Holmes as
          serts be left Alice and tbe other Pitzel
          children at their father&apos; s home in
          Detroit a month ago, and since then has
          heard nothing from him.
          Holmee further stand that wben he
          came to Boston on &apos;Tuesday last be in
          tended to take paesage for Berlin, but
          changed his mind, and before he could
          perfect other plana the detectives bad
          him.
          HOLMES&apos; VICTIMS.
          Good Reason to Believe He Murdered
          tbe Williams Sisters.
          Fort Worth, Tex., Nov. 20.—There is
          every reason to bolieve that C. H.
          Holmee, who went by tbe name of O. C.
          Pratt in Fort Worth, ia guilty of mur
          dering Minnie X, Wiliiame und her sis
          ter Ann. The crime waa probably com
          mitted in Chicago, and in this crime a
          man who claimed here to be a
          citizen of Chicago and called himself
          Benton T. Lyman, is an accomplice,
          Some time iv February be came here
          from Chicago and placed on record a
          deed from one Bond to Lyman for ICO
          feet front on Husk und Second etreete.
          Bond got title by deed from Minnie
          R. Wiliiame, executed before a no
          tary, whoan name was said to be
          HolmeD. Oa this property Lyman
          beaaii the erection of a three-story
          huilding. Lyman had sold one lot to a
          Fort Worth citizen who, fearing the title
          wae clouded, began to invest gate. He
          found that Minnie R. Wiliiame wrote
          late in 1803 to her sister Miss Ann Wil
          ium*, of Midlothian, Texas, to come to
          Chicago, tnat she v. a a going to bs mar
          ried and go to Europo. The sister left
          for Chicago. No word ever came from
          either of tbe Bistere.
          Minnie K. Williams, by will, was left
          half a block of property in tbe heart of
          Fort Worth, valued at $60,000, and a
          farm valued at $15,000. Thiß property
          has all been alienated, ostensibly by
          Miss Wiliiame. A detective has recent
          ly been sent to find the girls, but no
          trace can be discovered.

          Still Alive.
          Seen in Chicago Less Than Two
          Weeks Ago.
          Swindler Holmes&apos; Trail of Crime—lie
          Was Often In Indianapolis- A.
          Third Woman Victim
          Discovered.
          By the Associated Press,
          Philadelphia, Nov. 21. —The Pitzel
          mystery deepens as time wears on. To
          day many theories in regard to the mys
          tery were knocked in the head by tbe
          announcement tbat 13. F. Pitzel, the
          supposed murdered man, was seen in
          Chicago less than two weeks ago. Pres
          ident Fouzof the Fidelity Life Insurance
          company said today:
          &quot;This morning my Chicago represen
          tative telegraphed me tbat a Mr. Bryan,
          who is a bueiness man in Chicago, called
          on him and said that B. F. Pitzel was
          in tbat city less than two weeke ago.
          Mr. Bryan says be bas known Pitzel for
          many years, and had frequent business
          transactions with him, and it is impos
          sible fot him to be mietaken. When
          they met, Bryan did not know Pitzel
          wae euppoeed to be dead, and tbe two
          greeted each otber cordially and re
          paired to a near-by ealoon where they
          bad a drink together. Then tbey sep
          arated and Bryant saye he doee not
          know whether Pitzel was to remain in
          thecity or not. However, our men there
          and tbe Pinkerton detectives have taken
          up the clew, and it is my opinion that
          Pitzel will be produced within a few
          dayp.&quot;
          President Fcuz called on Mrs. Pitzel
          and her daughter at tbe Central station,
          tiday, and received valuable informa
          tion Irom tbe daughter in reference to
          her father. The daughter said she re
          numbered while walking with her fa
          ther one Sunday in Chicago that tbat
          latter bad said to her: &quot;If you ever hear
          through the newspapers or any otber
          way tbat I iiave been found dead, do not
          believe it. I will be all right.&quot;
          Later on, while in Boson, she read
          the story ot her father&apos;s death in a news
          paper. As soon as she had finished the
          etory, Holmes said to her: &quot;Do you re
          member what your father told you the
          afternoon you were walking in Chi
          cago?&quot;
          Daring Mr. Fouz&apos;e interview with the
          daughter, Mrs. Pilzal grew excited and
          exclaimed &quot;They have all deceived me,
          even my own daughter.&quot;
          Mrs. Pitzsl said she remembered re
          ceiving a letter from her daughter Alice
          in which she related her experience
          while coming east for the purpose of
          identifying her father&apos;s body. Alice
          etated that Howe and Holmes accom
          panied her and both were sociable with
          each otber on the trip east. This eets
          at reet the claim of Howe that be never
          met Holmes until introduced to him by
          President Fouz on hia arrival in this
          city.

          ANOTHER WOMAN VICTIM.
          Chicago, Nov. 21. —Following cloae on
          tbe atory of tbe mysterious disappear
          ance of the Wiliiame aiatera at tbe hands
          of Holmee, tbe life inenrance swindler,
          comes a (iiird woman victim, namely
          Miss Kate Durkee. Miss Durkee had
          property. Documents representing the
          property came into the bands of H. H.
          Holmes by theft. The woman mysteri
          ously disappeared, and Holmes showed
          title to the property. Mies Durkee was
          not Miss Williams; she bad dark eyes
          aud hair, while Miss Williams waa a
          blonde. A year ago today 25 creditors
          oi H. H. Holmes met at tbe office of
          George B. Chamberlain and made a des
          perate effort to find out who and where
          Miss Durkee was. It waa supposed she
          was an accomplice of Holmes; tbat
          property, illegally obtained waa being
          trauaferred to her name. Tbe creditors
          wished to reach it. Suddenly Kate Dur
          kee dropped entirely from sight, like
          tbe Williams sisters, and left no trace
          behind.
          &quot;I believe she waa murdered,&quot; said
          Chamberlain today. &quot;I believe also
          tbat both Williams girls wore mur
          dered.&quot;
          Mr. Chamberlain, as proprietor of the
          Lafayette Mercantile agency, began an
          investigation of Holmee a year ago.
          Mtss DUBKBK FOUND.
          Miss Dnrkee bas not been murdered,
          Sbe has been found in Omaha. A dis
          patch from that city tonight saye:
          Miss Kate Durkee, lives here in
          this city witb ber brother, who is
          assistant auditor of tbe Burlington rail
          road. She expreeeed aurpriee wben
          asked concerning ber connection with
          Holmes&apos; family in Chicago. She never
          heard of but one wife. Hie recently
          visited Mrs. Holraea and made Holmee
          transfer a piece of property in Chicago for
          ber. She refused to explain what prop
          erty this was, hut declared that Holmes&apos;
          Chicago lawyer was familiar with the
          deal.
          Attorney Duncombe of this city said:
          &quot;Holmes employed me to attend to
          some business for him, and in the courae
          of the action for which I waa retained it
          became necessary to take the deposition
          of Miss Kate Durkee. In her evidence
          she eaid she waa related to the wife of
          Holmeß.&quot;
          Mr. Duncombe said he had frequently
          seen Pitzel in company with Holmes
          and that ho would know whether ttie
          corpse in question waa the body of
          Pitzel if be aaw it.

          in Toronto.
          THREE FIENDISH CRIMES.
          The Notorious H. H. Holmes
          Accused of Taking Their
          Lives.
          RECORD OF MANY KILLINGS.
          It Is Thought the Insurance Swin
          dler Had Murdered the Elder
          Pietzel.
          TORONTO, Ont., July 15.— The bodies
          of Etta, Alice and Hettie Pietzel, the miss
          ing daughters of Benjamin F. Pietzel,
          were found by Detective Cuddy of Toronto
          and Detective Greyer of Philadelphia, to
          day, buried in the cellar of the house
          No. 16 St. Vincent street. H. H. Holmes,
          now under arrest at Philadelphia, is be
          lieved to have deliberately murdered the
          girls after he had first murdered their
          father in Philadelphia and their brother in
          Detroit.
          Inquiries began by the police to-day and
          led to the knowledge that Holmes and the
          children lived at the house in question,
          and search was made by the two ottioers.
          A photograph of Holmes was shown to
          Frank N. Nudel of the Ontario Educational
          Department, who owns No. 16 St. Vincent
          street, and without hesitation he identified
          it as that of the man who had rented the
          house from him last October, and after a
          very short stay had departed.
          When they reached the cellar it appeared
          to the detectives that something had dis
          turbed the cellar floor, and arming them
          selves with shovels they began to dig. A
          short distance below the surface they came
          across the arm and a portion at the head of
          one of the girls, and further work soon re
          vealed the bodies of all of the victims.
          They were nude and apparently had lain
          there since last October.
          City Detective Inspector Stark was com
          municated with and gave instructions that
          the bodies be removed, and they were
          taken to Humphrey&apos;s undertaking estab
          lishment on Yonge street. Coroner Orr
          was informed of the ghastly discovery, and
          called an inquest to be held at Police
          Headquarters to-morrow night. It is un
          derstood that the jury will meet pro forma,
          and after viewing the bodies will adjourn
          for one week, to enable the Crown authori
          ties to work up evidence. The bodies of
          the little ones were buried three feet from
          the surface and were in a fair state of
          preservation.
          Holmes, the alleged murderer of the
          girls, is held in Philadelphia on a charge
          of conspiracy, and a nice legal point now
          presents itself. The murders have been
          committed in Canada, the accused
          must be tried within its boundaries, but
          as Holmes has pleaded guilty to one
          charge in the United States he may insist
          on being sentenced for that.
          H. H. Holmes, alias Harwam W. Mudg
          ett, alias H. H. Howard, was born in New
          Haven, Conn., and attended a medical
          school at Burlington, Vt.,and later at Ann
          Arbor, Mich. He was married at the
          latter place. He and a friend swindled an
          insurance company in Chicago om of
          $12,000 soon after graduating. They made
          another haul of $10,000 in a similar way.
          Holmes went into the drug business and
          speculated. His wife went home and he
          married another woman, with whom he
          went to California.
          Returning about a year ago, he went to
          housekeeping with the woman typewriter
          of the company, whose acquaintance he
          had formed. He tried to cheat a fire insur
          ance company out of $00,000, but failed,
          and learning that his typewriter and her
          sister had inherited $50,000 laid a scheme
          to ket the money. The sister came to live
          with them and suddenly disappeared,
          while he and Minnie, the typewriter girl,
          took up their abode at the Plaza Hotel,
          Chicago.
          Holmes next appeared in Terre Haute,
          Ind., where he bailed Pietzel out of jail.
          From there he went to Franklin, Ind.,
          where he married Miss Yoke, and they
          spent their honeymoon in Denver, where
          Holmes made $27,000 in speculation.
          At Philadelphia, later on, he and Fietzel
          played the last card. Pietzel wu insured
          in the Philadelphia Mutual for $10,000.
          On September 3 he was found dead in the
          house at 1316 Callowhill street, which he
          had rented under the name of B. F. Perry.
          His body was badly burned and the face
          was almost unrecognizable. Holmes and
          Pietzel&apos;s wife&apos;s children identified the body
          as Pietzel&apos;s, and $7500 of the insurance was
          paid over.
          Then Train-robber Hedgespeth gave the
          whole case away to Chief of Police Harri
          son because Lawyer Howe, whom he had
          got into the conspiracy, had not paid
          him the promised reward. Holmes was
          traced to Toronto, Burlington and Boston,
          and in the latter city was arrested. Mean
          while the Pietzel children haa disappeared,
          the boy being traced to Indianapolis and
          two girls to Toronto. Holmes awaits
          sentence in Philadelphia for insurance
          fraud, and the police expect to fix several
          murders on him.
          Doctors who have examined the bodies
          agree with Detective Grier&apos;s theory that
          the girls were killed by hypodermic injec
          tions of morphine. Holmes is known to
          be an expert user of injections. J

          One of the Boldest Scoundrel* Ever Ar
          ralngrd for a Crime.
          PHILADELPHIA, Pa., July With
          the finding of the bodies of the Pietzel
          children in Toronto, a chapter in the his
          tory of one of the most sensational crim
          inal cases in the annals of this country is
          closed, and the net of the law is being
          drawn more closely about one of
          the boldest scoundrels who have ever
          been arraigned at the bar of justice.
          Herman Mudgett. alias H. H. Holmes, is
          in the County Prison here awaiting sen
          tence to the confessed charge of conspiracy
          in defrauding the Fidelity Life Association
          of Philadelphia. out of $10,000 by palm
          ing off upon it a bogus body
          as that of Benjamin F. Pietzel, a
          policy-holder of the company. The case
          exceeds in interest the most sensational
          novel ever written, and has so many sides
          to it that it ts difficult to even outline it in
          the ordinary length of a newspaper dis
          patch.
          In July, 1889, tne Fidelity Life Associa
          tion issued a policy for $10,000 upon the
          life of Benjamin Pietzel. Shortly after
          this, a man giving the name of B. A.
          Perry rented a house at 1319 Cailowhill
          street, this city. In September of the
          same year a lire, shown to have been
          caused by an explosion, occurred at the
          house and the charred body of Perry was
          found.
          A short time after this Jephtha B.Howe,
          an attorney at St. Louis, presented a claim
          to the Fidelity Company for the $10,000 on
          the life of Pietzel, alleging that the man
          found in the house at 1319 Callow
          hill was Pietzel. With Howe were
          Alice, the 13-year-old daughter of Pietzel,
          and Holmes, the arch conspirator in the
          case. The body of the supposed Perry had
          beenburied in the potter&apos;s field, but was ex
          humed, and Alice and Holmes positively
          identified it as that of Pietzel. The money
          was paid to Howe and the party returned
          to St. Louis.
          Mrs. Pieteel was in St. Louis at this
          tini-&apos;, and through the representations of
          Holmes that she could aid her husband in
          furthering his interests, had consented to
          become a party to Holmes&apos; scheme to de
          ceive the insurance company by passing
          off upon it a bogus body as that of Pietzel.
          Holmes told her that he and Pietzel had
          procured a corpse in New York and had
          had it up in the house at 1319 Cailowhill
          street and that this was the body found.
          Mrs. Pietzel believed this story, and to aid
          her husband consented to take part in the
          deception.
          The insurance company became sus
          picious, and setting detectives upon
          Holmes&apos; track built up a case against him,
          and in November last year Holmes was
          arrested in Boston.
          A few days after Holmes&apos; arrest Mrs.
          Pietzel was arrested in the same city and
          Howe was arrested in St. Louis. Holmes
          offered to relieve her of the burden
          of the three children. The oldest and
          the youngest child remained with Mrs.
          Pietzel and Holmes took the other three.
          Alice, Nettie and Howard. After parting
          with her children, Mrs. Pietzel has never
          been able to obtain from Holmes any defi
          nite Knowledge of their whereabouts.

          Dnst of Two Women and Mats of
          Hair Found in a Bed of
          Clay.
          CHICAGO, July 27. More con
          clusive evidence than has heretofore
          been collected by the police in the
          Holmes case was revealed by the
          investigation tonight. Inspector
          Fitzpatrick believes it to be certain
          that at least three murders were
          committed in the &quot;castle&quot; of Holmes,
          and through witnesses that were
          found today it is believed Holmes
          can now be convicted of murder in
          this city. The police have found a
          man, whose name they refuse to di
          vulge, but who was brought to the
          office of the inspector this afternoon
          by Lieut. Thomas and Officer Foley,
          of the Cottage Grove avenue sta
          tion. He told the police that he had
          mounted three skeletons for Holmes,
          and that the skeletons were from
          bodies taken from the house of
          Holmes on Sixty-third street. One
          of these he said was the body of a
          man, and the other two were wom
          en. They were taken from a dark
          room in Holmes&apos; house in the night
          time, and two of the mounted skel
          etons were returned to Holmes. The
          flesh of the bodies had not been
          stripped from the bones when the
          bodies were given to the new wit
          ness, but the faces were so badly
          lacerated and torn that identifica
          tion would have been impossible.
          The police also found an expressman
          today who was able to give what the
          police think is important informa
          tion. The name of the expressman
          is Charles Humphrey, and in the
          month of June, 1893, he was hired
          by Holmes to deliver a box and a
          trunk at the union depot in this
          city. The box, according to Humph
          rey, was taken from a dark room
          and had the appearance of a coffin
          box. This was expressed to Phila
          delphia, while the trunk was sent
          in another direction.
          GHASTLY DETAILS.
          The story of the man who mount
          ed the skeletons is to the effect that
          in June, 1593, he was sent for by
          Holmes, who at that time was go
          ing under the alias of Gordon, and
          asked if he would articulate the
          skeleton of a man whose body was
          in the possession of Holmes. He ac
          cepted the job, and by the direction
          of Holmes he called at the house on
          a stipulated night. He was taken
          by Holmes to a room which would
          have been dark even in the day
          time. Stretched out on a table in
          the middle of the room was the body
          of a man. The skin was entirely re
          moved from the face, but in all other
          respects it was in good condition.
          The articulator and Holmes had
          some talk as to the best way of get
          ting the body out of the house, as
          Holmes said he did not want the
          neighbors to see it removed. It was
          finally agreed that the articulator
          should cut off the, arms, and that
          Holmes would provide for the re-
          moval of the rest of the corpse, j
          This was done, and the articulator I
          left the house carrying the arms
          with him in a sack. He had just
          reached his house, and was prepar
          ing to go to bed, when ,he was
          called to the front door by a loud
          knocking. He went down and
          found Holmes and another man
          there. They had the balance of the
          body, which had been cut into two
          more pieces after, the articulator
          left the house. Holmes left, after
          remarking that he would have an-
          VALKYRIE 111. DEFENDER; .r&apos;*~ v» ■■&apos;■■_ I
          other job for the man in a short
          time. True to his word, in Decem
          ber he sent for the articulator a sec
          ond time, and on the arrival of the
          latter at the house of Holmes he
          was taken to the same dark room,
          where en the same table where the
          body of a man had &apos;lain on the oc
          casion of his former visit, was the
          body of a young woman. The face
          of this corpse had been disfigured
          in such a manner that it was im
          possible to tell what she had looked
          like when alive. Y^YYY.Y
          The story of the expressman is to
          ST. PAUL, MINN., SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 28, 1895.---SIXTEEN PAGES.
          I the effect that he was hired by r
          Holmes one afternoon, and told not
          ito come to the house until after
          i nightfall. When the expressman
          kept his appointment he was given
          a box and a trunk by Holmes and i
          told to take them to the union depot. i
          When he was putting the box into
          the wagon he turned it on end, and i
          I was at once stopped by Holmes, who j
          told him that he was on no account i
          to keep the box in any other posi- I
          j tion except flat on the side. The or- i
          ders were to take the trunk and box I
          to the depot and leave them on I
          the platform, and he was told that j
          they would be taken care of. He
          saw only one man at the depot who
          seemed to be interested in the trunk I
          and the box. After Humphrey had
          told his story to the police tonight, j
          Pat Quinlan was brought up from j
          his cell and the two were placed
          face to face. The police will not j
          tell why this was done, but the
          general opinion is that it was done
          because Humphrey recognized Quin
          lan as the man at the depot. The
          expressman will be retained in cus
          tody as a witness.
          HIS THIRD TRIP.
          J In January, 1893, the articulator was
          I sent for a third time by Holmes, and in
          i the same room and on the same table
          j he found the body of a second young
          i woman, from whose face all the skin
          j had been removed. The articulator
          had this body taken to his home, where
          j he stopped the bones and mounted the
          i skelton. When he called on Holmes
          i for his pay the latter refused to give it
          i to him, and was, moreover, somewhat
          J in arrears on the bill for mounting the
          two previous skeltons. The two men
          could not come to terms and the dis
          pute finally ended by the articulator
          j retaining possession of the third skel
          ton, and he still has it it in his house.
          j He removed the skull tonight and
          brought it to the central police station,
          I where It now Is. The articulator will
          be kept under close surveillance for
          j some days yet, as the police do not
          I think that he has told them all he
          I knows about the murder in the &quot;cas-
          I tie.&quot; He said at first that Holmes
          j called at his house under the name of
          i Gordon, and later said that he be
          j came acquainted with Holmes through I
          j answering an advertisement for a man j
          I capable In the work of articulating
          j skeletons, and found that the advertise-
          S ment had been inserted by Holmes,
          j Afterwards he let drop some expres
          sions that showed that he had done
          j some work for Holmes prior to the time j
          that he claimed his acquaintance with
          i him began. This discrepancy in his
          j story decided the police to keep a close
          watch on him. The police declare that
          they have almost positive proof that
          J the first female body was that of
          I Emeline Cigrand and the second that of
          Annie Williams. It is the skull of
          Annie Williams that is now at the
          central police station.
          J BURIED IN QUICKLIME.
          In prosecuting the investigation of
          j the basement of the big brick house on
          j Sixty-third street today the workmen
          employed by the police came upon two
          graves. The indications are that in
          the graves were laid the bodies of Mm
          J nic and Annie Williams. Lime and
          j quicklime had accomplished their work
          j and the bodies had turned to native
          dust, but there still remained sufficient
          evidence to make the indentificati.on
          possible. Two soft spots in a bed of
          hard clay were the size of human bod- j
          ies, and where the heads would have I
          been were mats of long hair. One big
          strand was of light color, like that of
          Annie, while the other was of the&apos;
          brown hue of Minnie&apos;s hair.
          The juxtaposition of the mats of
          hair would indicate that the bodies
          had been laid side by side, the heads
          but a few inches apart. Twelve men I
          worked with picks and shovels in the
          I rear basement of the &quot;castle&quot; today.
          They were divided into two squads, i
          j One squad worked under the the tin i
          j shop and the other attacked the dirt
          j bottom of the. cellar, near the rear and I
          I west walls. It was clcse to the parti-
          tion between the rear and front cellars,
          j under the stairs leading from the tin
          I shop, that early in the afternoon the j
          i two masses of quicklime were found.
          I Two bones and masses of hair were
          found in them. A long, wooden, shal-
          j low vat was found two feet under the i
          ground. It was expected that when j
          cleared out evidences that a human I
          body had been buried there would be
          found but the examination resulted
          i in nothing of the kind. Either it was
          a blind sewer or a secret repository.
          A LETTER TO PAT.
          The police have found a letter from
          Holmes to Pat Quinlan, to which much
          importance is attached. The letter is
          j as follows:
          Dear Pat: Among ether fool theor
          ies, they think you took the Pietzel
          TO RACE FOR AMERICA&apos;S CUP.
          boy to Michigan, and either left him
          there or put him out of the way. I
          have always told them that I never
          asked you to do anything illegal,- but
          they are bull-headed. Oct. 13 I saw
          you at the factory, I think. Can&apos;t
          you show where you were all the rest
          of the month? If they question you
          or threaten to arrest you, tell- them V
          anything there is -to tell about this or
          any other matters. They want to
          know if you were in Cincinnati or In
          Indianapolis about&quot; Oct. 12. It &apos;is well

          into it. If the detectives would go to
          New York, as I want them to, they
          would find where Minnie W. took
          i them by boat. I have done no killing,

          MURDER OF JULIA CONNOR.
          Asphyxiated, Cut Up and Cremat
          ed hy Holmes.
          CHICAGO, July 27.-Mrs. Patrick
          Quinlan lost her defiant spirit in the
          police inquisition. Two days&apos; &quot;sweat-
          DOX experience proved more than she
          £m I»v.beai;1 »v. beai wit equanimity, and she
          told the police things which before had
          not been acknowledged. Chief of Po
          lice Badenoch said: Evidence secured
          from Mrs. Quinlan is highly important,
          fahe confessed to abetting Holmes in
          insurance swindles, and that is a step
          in the right direction. Patrick Quin
          lan, her husband, continues to protest
          he was a mere hireling, and roes not
          know Holmes&apos; affairs at all. Mrs. Quin
          lan s evidence was that, after Mrs.
          Connor s disappearance it became nec
          essary for Holmes to produce her to
          collect some insurance. Mrs. Quinlan
          consented to act in her place. She
          went to the insurance office and swore
          she was Mrs. Connor, and signed that
          name. According to the statements of
          Jonathan Belmont it was Christmas
          night, four years and six months ago,
          that Mrs. Connor was killed.
          He believes she was asphyxiated in
          her room while she slept. Her room
          was a small one adjoining the dark
          bath room in the &quot;castle.&quot; When all
          was still in the house Holmes switched
          on the gas. When the deed was ac
          complished Holmes stealthily admitted
          himself through- the secret door of the
          bath room, lifted the inanimate form
          ol Mrs. Connor from the bed, and car
          ried it to the bath room. Then, placing
          the body in the bath tub, he proceeded
          to cut It to pieces, and fed them to a
          hot fire in the stove. When all was
          done he took the ashes and parts of
          the body that had not been entirely
          burned and buried them in lime in the
          cellar. ■_._,.■..
          The police believe the chain of evi
          dence against Pat Quinlan now com
          plete, and Holmes&apos; ex-janitor will be
          tried for murder here.
          A HISSING BROTHER.
          &quot;Horace Williams Disappeared Be
          fore His Sisters Were Rilled.
          CHICAGO, July 27.— William Capps.
          the Fort Worth, Texas, attorney who
          is here in behalf of the heirs of the&apos;
          Williams sisters, advanced a rather
          startling theory today, which if found
          to be true, will add another victim
          to the long list of murders already
          credited to Holmes. According- to
          Capps, Minnie R. Williams had a
          brother named Horace A. Williams in j
          Denver, Col. This young man either 1
          was killed or disappeared in May .or
          June, ISS3, shortly before the supposed
          murder of the Williams .sisters. The
          manner of his death iSjiiot known to
          the attorney, but he says he has ascer
          tained that the young man was insured
          for $2,500 in favor of his sister Minnie.
          This fact Mr. Capps considers to be
          decidedly peculiar, as he says it is not
          reasonable to suppose Horace Williams
          would insure his life in favor of a sis
          ter who was already wealthy. He said
          that his Investigations upon this point
          were in an uncompleted state, but
          from what he had learned he was of the
          opinion that Holmes had first insured
          the young man and then been instru
          mental In causing his death.

          Williams Li, es Mediums Interview
          Enieline Cigrscd.
          Chicago, III., Aug. 2. The police have
          at last obtained a partial confession
          from Pat Quinlan, the janitor of the
          Holmes &quot;castle&quot; and have, they be
          lieve, positive evidence that Benjamin
          F. Pietzel was murdered in this city by
          Holmes and the corpse sent to Phila
          delphia. The confession was wormed out of
          Quinlan by means of a tip given the
          local officers by Detective Geyer of
          Philadelphia, who arrived in this city
          today. The exact nature of the story
          told by Quinlan the police will not re
          veal and in fact Chief Badenoch and
          Inspector Fitzpatrick have both denied
          that Quinlan or his wife made any con
          fession at all. Notwithstanding the
          denial of the police, however, it is posi
          tively known that Quinlan made a
          signed confession because it was left
          where Quinlan&apos;s signature on the docu
          ment could be seen, although the sub
          ject matter under which he wrote his
          name .could not be ascertained. Tonight
          however, it was learned that a confes
          sion was made covering all the detils
          of the murder of Pietzl with the ex
          ception of the actual place in which
          the crime was committed.
          This the police declare they will have
          tomorrow and they declare that by sun
          set of Aug. 5, they will have undisput
          able evidence that Pietzel came to his
          end through the direct agency of II. II.
          Holmes. The confession was obtained
          from the Quinlans only after the hard
          est kind of work, and at the price of a
          promise of immunity from punishment
          for all the part the Quinlan&apos;s may have
          borne in the murder of Pietzel or other
          crimes committed by Holmes.
          MINNIE WILLIAMS LIVES.
          Little Rock, Aug. 2. Attorney O. M.
          Humphreys of Fort Worth arrived here
          today and went almost imemdiately to
          the prison where he and Superintend
          ent McConnell were closeted for some
          time with Convinct Allen. Mr. Hum
          phreys represents the interests holding
          claims against Minnie Wiliam&apos;s prop
          erty in Fort Worth on debts contract
          ed by Holmes and his accomplices.
          After the conference he sead:
          &quot;Undoubtedly Allen knows more than
          anybody else about the transfer of the
          Williams property because he spoke to
          me intelligently about the various pa
          pers conected with the deal which are
          now In my possession and the contents
          of which have never been made public.
          I knew Allen in Fort Worth and from
          circumstances as yet unpublished which
          he mentioned to me today, in connec
          tion with those deals. I know he was
          intimate with Holme&quot;.&quot;
          &quot;Do you think Minnie Williams is
          still alive?&quot;
          &quot;I most assuredly do. From what I
          know and from what Allen said today,
          I am positive that she is not only liv
          ing but that she is in the United States
          and that were Holmes free he would be
          with her in less than forty-eight hours.&quot;
          WHAT MRS. QUINLAN KNOWS.
          Mrs. Pat Quinlan knew of the disap
          pearance of Mrs. Julia L. Conner in
          Holmes&apos; castle and saw the body of
          the woman after she was elead. She
          further knew and has admitted that
          Pearl Conner disappeared mysterious
          ly in the castle after her return from
          a trip to the Quinlan farm at Lake
          Michigan.
          Chief Badenoch took Mrs. Quinlan
          and her husband to the castle today
          with Inspector Fitzpatrick and detec
          tives Fitzpatrick and Norton. The ob
          ject of this trip was more for the pur
          pose of letting Quinlan and his wife
          meet than any other. They were clos
          eted together alone for an hour in the
          room in which the Julia Conner&apos;s car
          pet lies and the chair belonging to the
          murdered woman stands. What took
          place between them no one knows but
          Chief Badenoch and his detectives. The
          chief now has proof positive that Mrs.
          Connor and Pearl, her daughter, or Co
          ra Quinlan, were murdered in the main
          building while the mother was in
          Holmes&apos; employe. Quinlan has given
          information within the last twenty-four
          hours which brings the charge of mur
          der nearer to Holmes than it has been
          in Chicago at any time since the case
          opened. Quinlan and his wife while
          demonstrating to the police that they
          were at no time guilty of the crime of
          murder themselves have made admis
          sions by which the chief could use
          them on the stand as valuable witness
          es against Holmes in proving that Mrs.
          Conner anil a child were made away
          with by Holmes for the purpose of se
          curing insurance which Mrs. Cononr
          carried on her life in favor of her
          daughter or in which Cora Quinlan
          cut an important figure.
          Further, Quinlan and his wife have
          proved to the police that Mrs. Con
          nor was so Avell aware of the schemes
          which Holmes were operating that it
          became necessary for Holmes to put
          the woman out of the way.
          Mrs. Connor&apos;s bo lv was disposed of
          by burial within tne castle somewhere
          close to tfie spot where Pearl&apos;s sup
          posed body was found. The police have
          not ceased their effort&quot; to flnd the bot
          tom of the basement and uncover her
          remains. The digging which was sus
          pended today will continue tomorrow
          and during the coming week. Pat Quin
          Ian and his wife have admitted parti
          ally, the woman more than the man.
          that a business in receiving and dis
          posing of dead bodies stolen from
          country graveyards was carried on in
          the castle under tli direction of
          Holmes. The graveyards of the west
          ern portion of Michigan. Grand Haven
          South Haven. Muskeg.-.n.. Holland. St.
          Joseph. The Bay. Laka. all ancient
          places, with venerable graves were de-sp-Mled
          of bodies.
          The bodies were brought to the cas
          tle, chemically treated ani thn dis
          posed of to medfeal colleges The cof
          fins were re-made by Quinlan. Pietael
          and Holmes, reliaed and disposed of to
          undertakers at a fair profit.
          We have suOlcSent evidence to keep
          Holmes In prion for t he remainder of t
          his natural days&quot; said Detective Geyer
          toiay. &quot;wicnout cnarjnng- nim with

          escape the conspiracy charge in Phila

          en there he will probably be hanged
          As to all the Chicago charges there is
          only proof that he was a swindler. I
          believe it will be finally shown that
          he did murder Mrs. Conner and the
          two Williams girls. M&apos;nnie Williams
          J think, was killed last fall at the same
          time as Howard Pletsel.&quot;

          Richardson corroborates Chappeirs
          story. He fcas told the police all he
          knows oi noimes .ramc in mysterious
          packages ana ooxes ana Debtees the
          express companies receipt? in the Wash

          work Holmes had done is. the years I
          1S91-93 and where the &quot;packages&quot; he
          handled were delivered.
          The new witness said he did not
          know what these packages contained
          at the time they were handled. To the
          police he made no reservations but
          since Chappell says his traffic was in
          dead men&apos;s bones Richardson says he
          is quite prepared to believe it. The num
          ber of these trips to the Wallace street
          house he adds cannot be contained In
          twenty calls, nor thirty.
          &quot;X remember this special package
          very well,&quot; said Richardson. &quot;Holmes
          sent these boxes all over the city at
          times to physicians and medical stu
          dents and again to the hospitals direct
          A good part of the stuff was also taken
          to the various depots. He received a
          good many consignments himsplf from
          other points. The boxes handled as I
          remember them were strong and ticht
          C-nd there were also well headed barrels
          in numbers. I don&apos;t remember of see
          ing that old trunk Chappell turned up
          r.or do I recall any trips to dump stuff
          in the lake. I guess Holmes had use
          for most everything he handled with
          out throwing anything away.&quot;
          MEMPHIS KICKS ON ALLEN.
          Memphis, Tenn., Aug. 2. The Little
          Rock end of the Holmes murder sen
          sation is about petered out. In the next
          forty-eight hours the police will in all
          probability, have proen tha Convict
          John Caldwell could have had no con
          nection with Holmes and his crimes, as
          he was in the Tennessee penitentiary
          for horse stealing at the time he claims
          to have been operating in Fort Worth
          Tex., for Holmes. A few months ago
          he was pordoned but went Immediate
          ly to Arkansas and engnged in his for
          mer pursuit. There he again came to
          grief and was sent to the Arkansas
          state prison where he now is. The
          Memphis police are confident Caldwell&apos;s
          story is only a ruse to get out of prison.
          WANTS PAY FOR TALK.
          Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 2. &quot;Two
          hundred dollars, sir.&quot; is the cash value
          placed by C. W. Arnold, the insurance
          agent, on his knowledge of the career
          of Holmes. Nevertheless for the last
          two days Arnold has been a constant at
          tendant at the newspaper offices here
          and has been interviewed to his heart&apos;s
          content.
          Arnold was asked point blank today
          as to his holding shares in the com
          panies organized by Holmes for vari
          ous purposes. If you like to pay me
          $200 I will write out what I know and
          hand It to you and the Minneapolis pa
          pers shall publish it at the same time.
          I will dictate it myself to a stenograph
          er, but I tell you before hand I do not
          think it worth a cent to you, as I had
          no knowledge of any crimes. Holmes
          used my name In those companies with
          out my knowledge or authority. In the
          same breath he added: &quot;I never invest
          ed a cent in any of his companies and
          certainly had no knowledge of any of
          his swindling operations. I never went
          up stairs in the house or building. I
          never saw a stenographer or typewriter
          there. There was no handsome blonde
          typewriter there so far as I saw. I
          knew nothing of his vats or furnaces. I
          never sats them. I never saw, met, or
          knew Kmlllne Cigrand, Mrs. Connor,
          or her daughter, Mrs. Lee, Minle Will
          iams or her sister, nor Emily von Tas
          sel. I never insured any of those peo
          ple for Holmes or at Holmes sugges
          tion. All I can say is as to my person
          al dealings with and friendship for Mr.
          Holmes, and I am out for the stuff and
          intend to get it before I say anything.
          Two hundred dollars Is my price. You
          put up the money and I will write you
          a story of a dozen of extraordinary
          facts about Holmes, but I won&apos;t talk
          to reporters I am busyv There Is a
          good market for this kind of stuff. Why
          several novelists have already approac
          hed me and offered me large sums to
          tell what I know of Holmes for publi
          cation in book form. I am wanting the
          money and can use it In my business,
          nnd I shall not talk, I tell you, until I
          get it.&quot;
          Then Mr. Arnold, who had done most
          of the talking, waited for questions
          with the sang froid of an experienced
          politician. He was atked as to insur
          ances effected by him for Holmes or at
          Holmes&apos; instigation and claimed that
          he insured Holmes by three separate
          policies for $5,000 each, which policies
          Holmes neglected to pay for or take up.
          Arnold admits insuring Pietzel for 2000
          but claims that this policy lapsed and
          long before Pietzel met his end. When
          asked for particulars as to insurance
          companies for whom he worked in Chi
          cago, Arnold denied positively having
          worked for the Mutual Life of Philadel
          phia, the Northwestern or the Vermont
          and in the same breath refused to say
          what companies he worked for.
          When questioned closely as to his
          dealingswith Holmes he claimed that
          his acquaintance was purely a passing
          friendship, though he might have act
          ed as witness to various legal docu
          ments. As to the nature of these he
          essayed to be very mysterious and he
          point blank asked for pecuniary com
          pensation for divulging. He absolute
          ly denies that he was out from 11 p m.
          until 3 a. m. on any occasion attting
          legal documents for Holmes ar. I cut
          short the conversation bv sa ing be
          would talk no more until S200 was forth
          coming for his information.
          SPIRITS ARE INVOKED.
          Anderson, Ind., Aug. 2. The friends
          of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Cigrand, whose
          daughter Emeline is believed to have
          been one of H. H. Holmes&apos; victims, are
          much interested in the attempt by
          spiritualist seances to communicate
          with the spirit of Emeline. A number
          of people have had private sittings with
          mediums, but a they report no satis
          faction a woman whose name must be
          withheld went into a seance for the
          spirit of EmeJine.
          After sitting in a dark room for near
          ly two hours she ays there was a voice
          in the trumpet and she understood it to
          say:
          &quot;This is Emma. I went into the spirit
          land two years ago and was far from
          home. O, it was so horrible.&quot; Here the
          words became whispers and were not
          audible. Suddenly another voice said:
          &quot;I hope sister will soon join me. I
          have something awful to tell her. My
          husband is stil beyond the spirit land.
          I send love to mamma and papa, and
          tell the to and here the spirit stop-
          ped and could not be called again.
          Mrs. Bibbeth Seery. one of the best
          of Indiana mediums, was sen at her
          home in Muncie tonight. Sho would
          not attempt to call up the spirit of
          Emeline Cigrand, for she said it was
          absurd.
          &quot;The laws of aature are the govern
          ment r all mediums and spirit.&quot; said
          the medium. &quot;The dead girl would have
          to be well known to any one speaking
          who saould have talked with the girl
          in worldly life shortly before death. I
          Natural resources are arainst nie. for I
          saould one spirit be called and told to
          hont for the spirit of the girl it would
          not know the spirit. Should she- call
          circumstances attending her death a
          reported it would affect the spiritual
          condition
          A trance medium attempted to talk
          with the girl&apos;s spirit. He asuaied a
          trance state and speaking for a spirit

          various other persons In the famous Holmes
          elastic at Chicago.
          STORY OP THH ARREST.
          Benjamin F. Piterel&apos;s liody was round In
          a house at 131C Callow hill street 011 Sep
          tember 3, 1894. A shattered lamp was
          found by the side of -the body wliUh bore
          evidence of having iie-en turned, and the
          coroner&apos;s Jury concluded ttiat tlie oil lamp
          had exploded and that Pilczcl, who was
          at the time known as M. F. Perry, had been
          burned to deutti. and accordingly rendered
          a vcntUt or accidental death.
          There was no claimant ror the body and
          it was buried in Potter&apos;s field. Subse
          quently an assertion came iroin Mrs. Fltc
          zel&apos;s lawyer at St. Louis, Mr. Jeplha
          Uowe, that the body w.u that of Benjamin
          F. Pltezei, and a claim was made ou the
          Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Phil
          adelphia for $10,000, which that cotu
          pauy carries! on Pitezel&apos;s life.
          Tlie insurance company paid the claim,
          but not Is&apos;iiig satisfied tti.it Pllc-zel had
          niet his el am accidentally, at once placed
          delective3 on the case to solve the mys
          tery. This rcsu&apos;ltesl in tlie arrest in Bos
          ton or Mudgett, alias Holmes.
          The lane, was opu.uc. lure and vas
          placed 011 trial charged with conspiracy to
          defraud the insurance company. Holmes
          pleaded guilty to Ihjs charge, but to cum
          bat tlie more serious ciiarge of inurdtr
          claimed that Pilczcl is still litiiig: that a
          body was ohtaine-d from a Ner Vork dls
          sesting room arsljilactsl in the building on
          Callowhili strct. alter burning the skin
          sllghtlv and throning a lamp 011 the floor.
          Holmes (laiincd that he .mil Pltezei lelt
          the city and suhseeiui ntly informed Mrs.
          Pitezel that the body was that or her
          missing husband and had her press her
          claim for the insurance.
          GKYKU&apos;S DISCOVERIES.
          Holmes was sent to prison to await sen
          tence on tlie conspiracy trial, anil District
          Attorney Graham startesl Ilctcctlte Gcyer
          out to v lslt Toronto, Chicago and other
          Western cities, to endeavor to obtain ci
          dence against Holmes which would warrant
          his being arruigucs! for murder.
          Deles tle Geyer&apos;s sucoc-s In rinding the
          dead bodies or Ihe children Is well I. noun,
          and otlur rails which he gleanesl sallsricd
          District Attorney Graham that Holmes could
          be comlcied here o.the murder of Pltezei.
          Detective GPyer also brought to this city
          Mrs. Pltezei anil others from various parts
          or tlie Wist and Canada lo take the stand
          as wltnisssMS against Holmes.
          The approaches to the court room were
          closely guarded, and Hone but jicrsons di
          rectly intcre-sted in the caso.and newspaper
          men, were admitted. The case was called
          shortly after 10 o&apos;clock.
          Holmes walked Jauntily into tlie dock,
          a tipstaff being on cither side of him. He
          was rather pale from long conrincment in
          tlie county prison, but his black beard was
          neatly trimmed, and his black suit of
          clothing gave him adressy appearance.
          Tlie accused took his sent with a calmness
          that was noticeable, and whlleheetlnceda
          decided interest in the matters at issue,
          there was no look of fear upon Ms counto
          nance nor any evidence of nervousness in
          his action.
          SENSATIONAL EPISODE.
          Judge Arnold overruled the motions for
          postponement in a very few words, and
          ordered the trial to go on. Just at this
          Juncture a startling climax was reached,
          which resulted in the withdrawal of Law
          yers Shoemaker and Rotan from the case,
          notwithstanding an injunction from tho
          court that they would be open to disbar
          ment by taking such a step &quot;ou the eveof a
          murder trial.&quot;
          Stili further sensation was created wiien
          Holmes refused to accept the services of
          Attorney! Everett A. Sehofield and Joseph.
          R. Fahy, whom the court was about to ap
          point to -defend him and who, lu fact, had
          taken &quot;scats in the hairs vacated by Messrs.
          Shoemaker and Rotan.
          Sehorieldaud Fahy also withdrew. Holmes
          himself pleaded to the court for a post
          ponement, but the Judge declared that
          tho case must go on. The trial was re
          sumed, Holmes conducting his own defense.

          different to His Awiul
          Fate.
          DECLARING HIS INNOCENCE.
          The Execution Passed Off Without
          Any Incidents of a Sensa
          tional Nature.
          PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 7.—Her
          man W. Mudgett, alias H. H. Holmes,
          was hanged this&quot; mornine in the County
          Prison for tne killing of Benjamin F.
          Pietzel.
          The drop fellatlO:l2o&apos;cloctc, and twenty
          minutes later he was pronounced dead by
          the prison officials, Dr. Sharp and Dr.
          Batcher.
          The execntion was in every way entirely
          devoid of any sensational features.
          To the last Holmes was self-possessed
          and cool, even to the extent of giving a
          word of advice to Assistant Superintend
          ent Richardson as the latter -was arrang
          ing the final details. He died as ne had
          lived, unconcerned and thoughtless, ap
          parently, of the future, even with the rec
          ollection still vividly before him of the
          recent confession in which he admitted
          the killing of a score of persons of both
          sexes in different parts of the country.
          Almost his last words were a point-blank
          denial of any crimes committed except the
          deaths of two women at his hands by mal
          practice.
          Of the murder of several members of tbe
          Pietzel family he denied all complicity,
          particularly of the father, for whose death
          he stated he was unjustly suffering the
          penalty. With the prayer of the spiritual
          attendants still sounding in his ears and
          with a few low-spoken words to those
          about him tbe trap was sprang.
          There were comparatively few persons
          gathered on the outside of the prison dur
          ing the eariy part of the morning and the
          morbid throng which the prison officials
          expected would be drawn there by the
          execution was lacking. Access to the
          prison prior to the entrance of those per
          mitted to witness the execution was not
          allowed.
          All the arrangements for the burial of
          Holmes were entrusted by the murderer
          to Mr. Rotan. The place of interment has,
          it is understood, been selected, but those
          who are most likely to know where the
          grave is to be will not divulge the iov-a
          tion.
          Holmes retired about midnight and
          slept soundly during the entire time until
          called at 6 o&apos;clock this morning. So sound
          were his slumbers, in fact, that twice was
          he called before awauening. When the
          arrival of the Rev. Fathers Dailey and Me-
          Pake to administer the sacrament was an
          nounced he greeted them warmly, but
          witii no show of emotion. For nearly two
          hours they remained in the cell and then
          were succeeded by Lawyer Rotan, the le
          gal adviser of Holmes, who was also
          greeted pleasantly. There were several
          matters pertaining to Holmes&apos; worldly af
          fairs that will yet have to be settled and
          this time was taken in giving the final de
          tails and explanations. While discussing
          his affairs breakfast was served, consisting
          of eggs, toast and coffee.
          When the raeal was ended, shortly be
          fore 9 o&apos;clock, Holmes dressed himself in
          trousers, vest and cutaway coat of some
          dark mixed goods of a pepper and salt ef
          fect he aad worn frequently.
          At 10 o&apos;clocK the doors leading to the
          long corridor in which was placed the
          gallows were opened and, two by two, led
          by the Sheriff&apos;s jury, the spectators
          passea down. The last man had just
          passed through the doors and the latter
          closed when from behind was heard the
          slow and measured tread of the death
          party.
          The suspense was almost painful, brief
          though it was, when, preceded by Sheriff
          Clements and Superintendent Perkins,
          Holmes appeared and stepped on the trap.
          On the right was Father Dailey, to the
          left Fat; er McPake, and behind them
          Lawyer Rotan and Assistant Superin
          tendent Richardson. The little party
          stood a moment looking down, and then,
          in response to a signal from one of those
          beside him, Holmes stepped forward. He
          spoke slowly and with measured attention
          to every word— a trifle low at first, but
          louder as he proceeded, until every woid
          was distinctly audible.
          &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;I have very few
          words to say, in fact, I would make no
          statemeut at this time, except that by not
          speaking I may be made to acquiesce in
          my execution. I only want to say that
          the extent of my wrongdoings in the
          taking of human life consisted in the
          death of two women, they having died at
          my hands as the result of criminal opera
          tions. I wish to state also, however, so that
          there will be no misunderstanding here
          after, tnat I am not guilty of taking the
          lives of any of the Pietzel family, the three
          children or the father, Benjamin F. Piet
          zel, of whose death I am now convicted,
          and for which I am to-day to be hanged.
          That is all.&quot;
          As he ceased speaking he stepped back,
          and kneeling between Fathers Dailey and
          McPake, he joined with them in silent
          prayer for a minute or two. Again stand
          ing he sbook hands with all about him
          and then signified his readiness for the
          end. Holmes was the coolest of the wuole
          yiarty. He even went to the extreme of
          suggesting to Assistant Superintendent
          Richardson that the latter should not
          hurry himself.
          &quot;Take your time; don&apos;t bungle it,&quot;
          Holmes remarked as the official exhibited
          some little haste, the outcome of nervous
          ness. These were almost his last words.
          The cap was adjusted, a low-toned query,
          &quot;Are you ready?&quot; and an equally low
          toned response, &quot;Yes, good-by,&quot; and the
          trap was sprung.
          Holmes&apos; neck was not broken, and there
          were a few convulsive twitches of the
          limbs that continued for about ten min
          utes. &quot;But he suffered none after the
          drop,&quot; said Dr. Scott, the prison physi
          cian.
          The trap was sprung precisely at ]0:12)£,
          and fifteen minutes later Holmes was pro
          nounced dead, though the body was not
          cut down until 10:45. When ii was laid
          out on the stretcher occurred the only in
          cident approaching the revolting in con
          nection with the affair.
          The knot bad become jammed and the
          efforts of the doctors failed to loosen it as
          they attempted to remove the noose from
          about the neck. The head was twisted
          about from side to side in the attempt, and
          finally it was decided to cut the rope.
          Superintendent Perkins objected, however,
          and the knot was undone after several
          minutes of trying work.
          After the body had been viewed by the
          physicians and the manner of death dt
          termined the stretcher on whicn it lay was
          wheeled out of the corridor into the jail
          yard. Hero it was placed in an ordinary
          cheap pine coffin, wide enough and deep
          enough to have held two men of Holmes&apos;
          size. The coffin was put aboard an under
          taker&apos;s wagon and conveyed to the Roman
          Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Cross.
          The only persons at the cemetery were
          the undertaker and his assistant, two
          grave-diggers, two watchmen and a couple
          of newspaper men. The little company
          acted as pallbearers, and carried the coffin
          to the receiving vault. The last act in tne
          receiving vault was performed at Holmes&apos;
          express command.
          The lid of the coffin was taken off and
          the body was lifted out and laid on the
          ground. Then the bottom of tbe coffin
          was filled with cement. The body was
          then replaced in the coffin and covered
          with cement. It was Holmes&apos; idea that
          this cement would harden around his
          body and prevent any attempt at grave
          robbery. The coffin was left in the receiv
          ing vault under the guard of two watch
          men, who will remain on duty all night.
          To-morrow afternoon the body will be in
          terred in a grave in the cemetery, and it is
          probable that at the time religious serv
          ices will be conducted by Father Dailey.
          Holmes made no will and left no con
          fession. This is according to Mr. Rotan.
          He says he knows Holmes made no will,
          and, while the murderer gave him this
          mornine a big bundle of papers, the law
          yer says that he is confident that these
          papers relate only to private business
          matters. A3 yet Mr. Rotan has had no
          opportunity to examine them.
          Mrs, Pietzel was seen after Holmes was
          hanged. All she could say, between her
          sobs, was that she was glad that he had
          received her just deserts, but that his
          death would not return to her her hus
          band or her children. Mrs. Pietzel will
          return to her home, at Galva, 111., next
          week.
          The two women referred to by Holmes
          in nis confession from the scaffold were
          Julia Connor of Chicago and Emily
          Cigrand of Anderson, Ind.
          HOLMES&apos; MANY CRIMES.
          He Had a Ready &quot;Confession&quot; to Clear
          Himself of Ench.
          Herman W. Mudgett, better known as
          H. H. Holmes, was one of the most con
          spicuous criminals of modern times, and
          If the &quot;murder confessions&quot; which he has
          written can only partially be believed, he
          was without a peer as a bloodthirsty
          demon. His recent ingenious &quot;confes
          sion,&quot; wherein he claimed to have killed
          twenty-seven persons, was disproved,
          partly, at least, by the appearance of sev
          eral of the so-called victims: but Holmes&apos;
          object in making the &quot;confession&quot; was re
          alized the obtaining of a sum said to be
          $7500 and which amount is said to have
          been settled upon the criminal&apos;s 18-year
          old son. While the &quot;confessions&quot; have
          served to increase the sensationalism of
          the case, the only capital crime for which
          Holmes had to answer was the killing in
          this city on September 2, 1884, of Benja
          min F. Pietzel, bis fellow-conspirator.
          The murder was committed in the dwell
          ing, 1316 Callowhill street. Holmes&apos; con
          viction of murder in the first degree, the
          affirmation by the Pennsylvania Supreme
          Court of the verdict and the recent re
          fusal of Governor Hastings to grant a re
          spite, are so well known that a narration
          oJ these facts is unnecessary.
          Holmes was captured in Boston, Mass.,
          in the latter part of 1894 by Owen Hans

          Portland, Mich. Patrick Quinlan.
          who was said to be one of the. few men
          who might have explained the myste
          ries of &quot;Holmes&apos; Crime Castle,&apos; &apos;which
          was famous in the annals of Chicago
          crime, Is dead at his home near here.
          Before his death he told physicians
          ho had taken poison.
          Quinlan was a carpenter and was
          employed by Dr. J. J. Holmes to
          build the structure. The police held
          him for a time as a possible accom
          plice. Trap-doors, false partitions and
          numbers of wires were part of the
          equipment found&apos;ln the &quot;Castle&quot;.
          &quot;He couldn&apos;t sleep&quot; was the reason

          A few weeks ago word was sent
          over the telegraphic wires that Pat
          rick Qulnlan had killed himself In
          his home at Portland. Mich. The
          I telegram did not cause much of a
          llr. Quintan&apos;s name had been for
          gotten. A new generation Is read
          ing the newspapers, which nineteen
          years ago carried stories da.y after
          day for month about the remark
          ,i able murder system of H. H,
          Holmes, with whose name the name
          of Qulnlan was linked.
          I Quinlan proved his Innocence. He
          howed that he was only an em
          ploye of H. H. Holmes, arch-murderer.
          He proved that he was

          Holmes Castle. 701 Sixty-third

          times. Holmes Castle was a three-story
          is and I flat, looking more like an ordinary
          d the f residence than like a castle. In that
          place it Is believed four women, at
          lpn- I least, were slain. It was the retreat
          If to f the man who also had killed men
          jp iv I &apos;women and children In Philadelphia,
          r pro- Toronto and Indianapolis.
          d un-&quot; Tne castle was built admirably for
          iea it&apos;s a murdef shop. A dumb waiter ran
          for from the third floor to the basement
          are nfl there were no connections with
          t long ne dumD waiter on the intervening
          eill floors. The conveyance was big
          enough to admit of a man riding

          the rooms was ligantiC BtOVfe It

          in diameter. It was an ideal stove
          for tho burning of a human body.
          A person could be thrown into the
          stove bodily and could be burned to
          nothing.
          In tho basement were quicklime
          vats. Bodies could be thrown in
          quicklime and consumed. The flag
          ging in the basement could be torn
          up and bodies could bo buried be
          neath the flags.
          The trouble with the average sla
          er Is that he does not know what to
          do with the body of hLs victim.
          FINDING OF BODY
          STARTS SEARCH.
          The finding of the body of a vic
          tim always starts the search for the
          slayer. If a man could dispose of
          tho body he could slay on a whole
          sale plan and avoid detection.
          Holmes is believed to have built the
          castle with a view of hiding bodies
          of those he slew. He directed the
          work on the building. Qulnlan was
          only an ordinary workman who did
          what he was told unhesitatingly.
          Qulnlan never questioned the au
          thority of the slayer. He never
          asked who the women were Holmes
          had visiting him. He never asked
          where they went when they disap
          peared. He was an ideal servant.
          Born in a small Michigan commun
          ity he went to Chicago to make his
          fortune. Chicago was about to have
          a world&apos;s fair in commemoration of
          the. discovery of America.
          It was a good town to go to,
          thought Quinlan. An honest Irish
          young man, hla only thought of mak
          ing a living was by honest hard
          work. That Is why he went to work
          for Holmes and worked so wllllng
          ly and so faithfully. The other day
          w hen he drank the fatal potion he
          was middle-aged and broken in
          health. He looked as though he had
          been carried to the point of death
          by tho ghosts of the slain women of
          the castlo ho helped to build.
          It is said by some of his best
          friends that he often reproarhed
          himself for his part In the affair.
          Ho blamed himself for not suspect
          ing Holmes and turning him up to
          the police. Yet he could not bo
          blamed. Every thing in Holmes Cas
          tle seemed to be right. There was
          no sign of murder there. Every
          thing was quiet and still. The rooms
          were lined with asbestos and the
          dying victims never made a sound
          that reached the outsldo world.
          There at night In tho dark house
          they met their death.
          Some of them wero asphyxiated.
          It la believed. Others wore stabbed.

          Others were shot, according to the
          opinions of investigator. No one
          knows. Holmes knew and the vic
          tims perhaps could tell harrowing
          tales if they could talk, but theyr are
          gone and Holmes has been hung for
          his crimes, so In this world no one
          ever will know.
          How many crimes Holmes devised
          no one can tell. Tho first thing to
          attract the attention of tho world
          was the sudden, horrible death of
          B. F. PSetzel. a ihemlst. in Phila
          delphia He died In such a man
          ner that It seerued ho had been
          making chemical experiments and
          had met with an accident Mien his
          chemicals exploded. Holme-, whoso
          right name was Herman &quot;W. Mucl
          cett, telegraphed to St Louis to the
          homo of Mrs Pletzcl and told her to
          rome to Philadelphia and Identify
          the body.
          It is alleged that Holmes met Mrs.
          Pletzel and informed her the body
          was not that of her husband but
          that her husband had his life in
          sured for 10. 000.
          &quot;He&apos;s saf- in Canada.&quot; Holmes
          told Mrs Pletzel. &quot;He had itim
          frame up this body. It Is t-o badly
          mangled by the explosion that no
          one can ever recognize it Tou
          identify it and we 11 get the insur
          ance. Your husband said for me to
          gl e you half and bring the otner
          half to him.&quot;
          Mrs Pletzel later confessed that
          she Identifcd the body without be
          lieving it was that of her husband.
          She thought it was a big swindle
          game on the part of her husband
          and she entered into it readily She
          brought her three children. Alice,
          Nellie and Howard with her. Alice
          was 15 years old. Holmes sepa
          rated her from her children and
          took them to Toronto, Canada,
          Later the bodies, of Alice and
          Nellie were found In the cellar of a
          building Holmes had occupied at
          Toronto.

          RJB E ALED HOLMES.
          Marian Hedgepeth is the man who
          drat directed attention to Holmes.
          Holmes was conducting a drug atoro
          In St Louis when he was arrested on
          a minor charge and placed In jail.
          There ho met Marion Hedgepeth,
          noted as an out and out criminal.
          Holmes asked Hcdgepeth to tell him
          the name of some St, Louis lawyer
          who could give him assistance In
          putting over an Insurance swindle.

          Hedgepeth said he gave him the
          name. In return Hedgepeth was to
          get $500. The swindle was con
          summated. That is Pletzel was
          killed in Philadelphia in order to col
          let the Insurance, but Hedgepeth got
          no money.
          Then Hedgepeth notified Chief of
          Police Harrlgan of St. Louis that he
          had &quot;the biggest insurance swindle
          case the police ever had to deal
          with anywhere, anytime in the
          world&apos;
          He sent that message to Harrlgan
          October 9. 1894. Pietzel had died
          September 3. 1894. That failure to
          deal squarely with Hedgepeth is
          doubtless what cost Holmes his
          liberty and life and checked his
          long career of crime. Police at
          once set out to hunt for him. The
          Philadelphia death of Pietzel had
          caused them some wonder, but tho
          word from Hedgepeth made them
          doubly cure of crime. They trailed
          Holmes to Toronto, where the
          bodies of Alice and Nellie Pletzel
          were found. Later they found the
          body of Howard In Indianapolis and
          Identified it as that of Howard, be
          cause of some peculiar playthings
          he had. His body had been burned
          In a stove and the bones alone were
          left Intact.
          Holmes was found In Boston and
          arrested. He was going under tho
          name of Howard there. He was ar
          rested July 14. 1895.
          Mrs. Pletzel told her part in the
          afflr and tried to atone by fisht
          lng for the conviction of the man
          who had made her a widow and
          had slain three of her beautiful
          children.
          In Chicago the record of Holmes
          was looked up. When he was un

          trial for the death of Pletzel word

          swering his description, had taken
          women from their town and the
          unfortunates had never been heard
          from
          From Fort Worth came the In
          formation that Miss Minnie Wil
          liams and her sister, Anna, had
          been led away by Holmes several
          years before and no one had ever
          heard of them. It was found that
          Miss Minnie Williams had entered
          Holmes castlo under the supposi
          tion that she was to be the wife of
          the arch-slayer. She sent to Fort
          Worth for her sister. Anna, to be
          a bridesmaid at the w:diing.
          The sisters had JG0.000 worth
          of property In Forth Worth. They
          were induced to borrow heavily on
          the property and that Is the last
          anyone heard of them. Minnie, the
          bride-elect, died before the wedding
          In Holmes Castle Anna, the brides-mald-to-be.
          also died without ever
          having a chance to wear her bridal
          clothes What happened to tho
          bodies no one knows for certain.
          In the fine of the chimney, whlh
          led from the big stove on the top
          floor, hair was found. It Is believed
          that the hair was that of the sisters
          as It corresponded to their hair The
          theory was advanced at the time
          that the sisters were thrown Into the
          stove and burned. The suction of
          the flue carried the hair up In the
          flue, where it remained as mute evi
          dence against Holmes.
          From Davenport, Io., came an
          other story of disappearance and
          Holmes name was linked with that
          too. Mrs.v Julia Connor and her
          daughter were the missing ones.
          BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
          AND DAUGHTER LOST.
          For more than three years prior
          to 1 895, Mrs. Julia 1 Connor and
          her daughter, Pearl, had been mlss-
          ing from their friends in Iowa.
          Mrs. Connor had gone to Chicago
          v.ith her husband and daughter to
          work in a drug store conducted by
          Holmes. The drug store failed and
          Holmes gave the property to Con
          nor. Mrs. Connor was so taken with
          his generosity that she ceased to
          love her husband. She returned to
          Davenport and Connor obtained a
          divorce.
          Then she returned to Chicago, os
          tensibly to open a boarding house
          in Chicago or the suburbs. She and
          hor daughter never were heard of
          again. When Holmes was arrested
          in Philadelphia, relatives of Julia
          Connor claimed he killed her.
          Many bones wero found around
          Holmes Castle. He explained they
          were beef bones. He explained that
          the flat had been used as a restau
          rant during the World&apos;s Fair at Chi
          cago and that much meat was used
          there. He explained that the huge
          dumb waiter was used to convey
          food. He explained that the as
          bestos was to make the house fire
          proof and to keep out cold.
          He had an excuse for everything.
          He admitted he was crooked. He
          explained that he went to Toronto
          to smuggle furs into the United 111?!
          States. He admitted knowing alt
          the women ho was accused of mur-
          dering He admitted knowing Piet- Ewg
          zel. He denied killing any of them. H&amp;l
          Damaging evidence against him Bb
          were buttons of the women he was KhI
          charged with killing, which were
          found in his castle. bIH
          But the defense of Holmes netted LH
          him nothing. He swung from the hI
          gallows for his crimes.
          Though Holmes paid for his mis- jlfl
          deeds with death, Qulnlan suffered Bl
          much more than he. He was ar- LH
          rested with Holmes but freed.
          When he went back to his Mlchl- W
          gan home he found himself the cen- Btf
          ter of eyes Everywhere he went he
          was stared at or else he felt he B
          was stared at. While the rest of K&apos;
          the world forgot Holmes, the little Be-
          town Where he lived always re- K
          hearsed the story.
          No wonder the honest Irish Janl- flk I
          tor finally picked up a piece of paper H
          and wrote, &quot;I could not sleep.&quot; No &apos;K I
          wonder that after writing that slm- I
          pie line which told a story of nine- Q
          teen years of suffering and horror, E
          that he took poison and ended it R
          all.

          Eine Frauensperson, die sich als Frau

          George H. Thomas und der späteren Ver—-

          Holmes und Pitzel. Das Frauenzimmer
          sagte, sie sei Holmes&apos; Frau und er habe sie
          während der letzten zwei Jahre schlecht be—
          handelt; sie hoffe, durch seine Ueberführungz
          sich ihren Antheil an seinem Eigenthum zu
          sichern. Das Hatelregister zeigt, daß Pinzel
          am 19. Januar 1894 im Gilmore Hotel
          abgestiegen war, was mit dem angeblichen
          Geständniß der Frau übereinstimmt.</text>

        <text>OUR PARIS LETTER.
          The head of the new Colossus,
          *&apos;Liberty,&quot; which is in future to
          light all nations into the harbor of
          New York, has produced a profound
          impression on the visitors to the
          Exhibition. It is placed on the
          left-hand side of the grounds of the
          Champ de Mar&apos;s, looking towards
          the Seine. The face is very fine
          somewhat resembling that of the
          Apollo Belridere, and the effect from
          the othr side of the grounds, two
          thousand feet off, or so, is remark
          ably grandL- For the first time a
          modern sculptor has achieved that
          in which the&apos; Greeks seemed to fink?
          no difficulty whatever, namely, the
          necessary exaggeration of parts to
          produce effect at a great distance.
          M. Bartholdi has had a great success
          so far. The astonishment of the
          mass of visitors is amusing, and
          their presence serves to bring out to
          an observer the full grandeur of the
          work by comparison. A staircase
          is established within the head, and
          hundreds of visitors ascend every
          hour, while thousands wait their
          turn. The staircase leads up to the
          eyes of the figures, which serve as
          windows. From head to foot, half
          the height of the Monument of Lon
          don the arm which holds a &quot;flam-
          beau,&quot; that is to say the lantern of
          the lighthouse, measures forty feet
          but the details read even more curi
          ously. Thus, the arms measure
          riearly seven feet in diameter, the
          hand is more than fourteen feet
          long, and twenty inches in diameter
          lastly, the finger nail measures more
          than fourteen inches by twelve. The
          platform which is to surround the
          lantern, will measure nearly four
          feet in width and will hold ten per
          sons, and allow space for them to
          circulate without difficulty. The
          head is surrounded by rays] whicit.
          lire to be illuminated.
          The Colossus is to stand on a base
          e&apos;rec ed on a rock, the base, contain
          ing the keepers residence and the ac
          cessories of a lighthouse. This base
          will measure more than eighty feet
          high, so that the top of the head of
          the figure will be little short of two
          hundred feet from the ground.
          The whole is formed of sheets of
          copper reponse and bolted together,
          and the quantity of metal required
          will bo thirty tons while the iron
          framework, including the .stair-ease
          within the statue, wiil weigh about
          seventy tons more.
          T&apos;he statue of the Republic, a grand
          seated figure, by Clesinger, which, is
          placed in the terrace before the chief
          entrarJc&apos;C of Exhibition, is, with ita
          blinth, about the height of the face
          of the Colossus. M. Clesinger is said
          to have received 800 for his wofk.
          Sculpture is certainly in the as
          cendant just now in France, last
          year, a sculptor, M. Chapu, took
          one&apos; of the Grands Prix d&apos; Honneur
          and the Prix du Salon, a traveling
          scholarship, and this year the Salon
          juries have awarded both of the
          Grands Prix, as well as the Prix du
          Salon to sculptorsM. M. Barrias,
          Belaplanche and Hector Lemaire.
          The group in bronze which won M.
          Mercie the Prix d&apos; Honneur in 1874,
          is perhaps the most remarkable ex
          ample of the sculptor&apos;s art produced
          in France since the last Exhibition
          it consists of two figures, an angel,
          bearing the dead body of a Warrior,
          with broken sword still clutched in
          his hand, with wings oiitstrechect,
          and feet just about to quit the earth
          the figure of the angel is remarkably
          noble, and admirably posed. This
          work stands at the present in the
          central garden, in the Champ de
          Mars, building, but is to be erected
          in the Square Montholon.
          A trial of ploughs on a large scale
          recently took place with the authori
          zation of M. Krautz, at VelitBrurg,
          near Ivry, on the Lyons Line, on
          the farms of M. Decanville, who
          worthily inherits from his father
          the title of one of the most eminent
          agriculturists iu France. M. De
          canville is a large purchaser of
          American agricultural implements,
          and habitually uses on his property
          both steam ploughs, as well as
          steam-rollers, scarifiers, and barrows
          of American manufacture. All these
          we&apos;re in full work at the trial, and
          nearly monopolized thefattention of
          the wondering peasantry, who flock
          ed in great numbers from neighbor
          ing communes. The rapidity and
          neatness with which steam-ploughs
          do their work make spectators mai*
          vel that any others can be used,
          but the prime cost of the
          machinery is a great ir con
          sideration to small farmers. There
          were plenty of* more old-fashioned
          specimens of agricultural labor to
          be criticised: four-horoe and two
          horse ploughs four-ox and two-ox
          ploughs and one plough with six
          heavy horses and seven men whose
          performance was generally &quot;por-
          nounced a sad waste of labor, especi
          ally as, a pair of oxen side by side
          with one man seemed to plough quite
          as deep and good a furrow. The
          jurors, among whom where the Sena
          tors Feray and Toucher de Caveil,
          who both are stated to be landowners
          in the department, will not give
          their verdict for some days. Some
          Arab chiefs, wearing many decora
          tions, and three Chinese of high rank
          walked after the plows and partook
          of a breakfast given by M. Decan
          ville.
          One of the most striking charac
          teristics of the Exhibition&apos;buildings
          is the emproyment of terracotta and
          enamelled earthenware in their deco
          rations. This employment meets
          the ejTe
          almost everywhere. The
          front and back of the building on
          the Champ de Mars have series of pi
          lasters decorated with square slabs of
          brightly colored faience the. orna
          mentation consisting cf two designs
          alternating with each other, one
          composed principally of :birds, and
          the other of fruits and foliage- One
          of the most remarkable colors in
          these slabs is a fine bright red, and
          this is said to have been discovered
          during the- experiments made, with
          the view to the production of the
          slabs in question. Another applica
          tion of decorative pottery is to be
          seen around the doors of the pavil
          lion of the City of Paris, in the en
          closed garden in the autre of the
          Champ de Mars, where is &apos;a double
          border of large square slabs, terra
          cotta and faience, in reality I believe
          only immitations in plaster. But
          the most remarkable application is
          that on the fronts of the pavillions
          of the fine art galleries which face
          the doors of the city pavillion. These
          are works of great magnitude each
          front consist of three arches, the
          central one pierced below with a
          door. Over the door and on each
          side of the northern porch, are fig
          ures of poetry, painting, and other
          arts, larger than life, and three land
          scapes of great area, with a grand
          expanse of sea, a village on the cliffs
          architectural motives amidst grand
          trees, decorative colors, and other
          elements. All this is executed in
          large tiles and with much success.
          The blues and greens in the coloring
          are remarkably fine, and the firnig
          shows very few faults while the tiles
          are so flat and regular, that the joints
          are only apparent at a very-short dis-
          tance. ALPHA.

          Public sentiment hbar been thorough
          ly aroused at last, ini favor of the move
          ment toward the erectingof Bartholdl&apos;s
          statute, &quot;Liberty Enlightening the
          World,&quot; inu the harbor of New York.
          Americans now understand that those
          among them who subscribe to the
          completion of this grand work, will
          perform an act of patriotism, and at
          the same time one of International
          comity worthy of the enlightened
          ideas permesting this nineteenth
          century.
          Some idea of the extent of the pub
          lic sentiment is shown by the fact tbat
          the New York World has been able to
          report subscriptions of over $30,000 in
          a month&apos;s time, in sums averaging
          less than $1&quot; each, the great bulk of
          these contributions being in dimes
          and quarters.
          What a aiagniflcent object it will be,
          towering almost into the clouds from
          New York&apos;s beautiful harbor I It will
          stand as a grand symbol of liberty be
          fore the eyes of every one coiaiug froll
          the oppressed countries beyond the
          ocean. At the gateway of no other
          nation oould it stand with such ap
          propriateness. Here it symbolizes the
          fullest achievement of human freedom
          and will forever stand to tell that story.
          The committee in charge of the erec
          tion of the pedestal for the reception
          of this great work have prepared a
          beautiful statuette, as a souvenir tb

          It is one of the grandest undertak
          ings of modern times and eminently
          fitting that it should be built from the
          hearts and pockets of our people.
          The committee does not believe the
          American people are indifferent to
          this great work, therefore calls upon
          them for their aid. Every person
          wishing to secome a sobscribershould
          soend their address to Richard Butler,

        <text>BARTHOLDI&apos;S STATUE.
          Liberty Enlightening the World.
          This now Wonder of the World, which is
          now being loaded on the French transport lsere
          for shipment to this country, is tho largest
          statue in tho world. Somo idea of its magni
          tude may bo obtained from tho fact that 40
          persons found standing room within the head.
          A six-foot man standing on tho level of tho
          lip3 only just reached the eyebrow. Whilo
          workmen wero employed on the crown of her
          head they seemed to bo making a huge sugar
          caldron, and they jumped with caso in and out
          tho tip of tho nose. Fifteen pcoplo might sit
          round tho flame of tho torch, which elevation
          can bo reached by a spiral staircase within tho
          outstretched arm.
          Tho London Daily Ncics, in speaking of it,
          says It is out aud away the largest statue of
          modern times. Tho Colossus of Rhodes was
          nothing to it. It could carry tho &apos;Bavaria&apos; or
          tho &apos;Hermann&apos; in its arms. It towers to tho
          skies from tho yard of the Ruo do Chazelles,
          whoro it has been eight years in construction,
          and tho view from its coronet sweeps clear of
          the six-story hbuses and beyond tho walls of
          Paris.&quot;
          Tho weight of this stupendous statuo is 440,
          000 pounds, of which 170,000 pounds are cop
          per and tho remainder wrought-iron. It is
          expected to arrivo in New York about the 25th
          of May, whero it will bo erected ou Bedloe&apos;s
          Island, this being the location selected for it by
          Gen. W. T. Sherman, who was appointed by tho
          President to mako the selection. When placed
          in position it will loom up 305 feot above tide
          water, tho hight of tho statuo being 151.2 feet,
          that of tho pedestal 91 feet, aud foundation
          52.10 feet.
          This imposing statue, higher than tho enor
          mous towers of the great Brooklyn Bridge or
          the steeple of Trinity Church, which is tho
          loftiest in tho city of New York, higher, in
          fact, than any of tho colossal statues of anti
          quity by its rare artistic proportions, as well
          as by its stupendous dimensions, will add an
          other to tho Wonders of the World. A word
          should bo said of its artistic &quot;merit. The pose,
          stride, and gesture, with its classic face, aro
          pronounced perfect; the drapory is both mass
          ive and fine, and in some parts is as dclicato
          and silky in effect asif wrought with a fino
          chisel on tho smallest scale.
          The committco in charge of the construction
          of the baso and pedestal for tho reception of
          this great work aro in want of funds for its
          completion, and have prepared a miniaturo
          statuct, an exact counterpart of tho original,
          six inches in hight, tho ilguro being made of
          bronze, the pedestal of nickel silver, which
          they aro now delivering to subscribers through
          out tho United States for tho small sum of $1
          each. Aside from its being a lasting souvenir
          of this colossal statue, it will ornament onr
          homes and bear testimony that wo have con
          tributed to tho completion of ono of the grand
          est works of&amp;modcrn times. All remittances
          should bo addressed to, Richard Butler, Secre
          tary American Committee of the Statuo of Lib
          erty, No. 33 Mercer Street, New York. Tho
          committee aro also prepared to furnish a model,
          in samo metals, twelve inches in hight, at $5
          each, delivered.
          Boston and tho Bartholdi Pedestal.
          Mr. Carl Schoenhof, Treasurer of tho Boston
          Bartholdi Pedestal Fund, reports tho offer of a
          citizen of Boston to bo ono of 100 contributors
          of $500 each to completo tho subscription of

          T&amp;e Prejudices Met By a Canvasser
          the Pedestal Fund.
          The Bartholdi pedestal fund is nearly
          complete. The statue has arrived and
          soon New York harbor will be graced
          by the most magnificent colossal statue
          the world has ever seen.
          &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World!&quot;
          What a priceless blessing personal li
          Derty is. It is the shrine at whiclf
          people, ground under the heel of ty
          ranny in the older worlds,, worship
          with a fervency that Americans can
          scarcely realize it is a principle for
          which Nihilists willingly die the death
          of dogs andfitand proper it is that
          at the very entrance of the Bay of New
          York this emblematic statue should
          flash a welcome to the world.
          The press is entitled to the credit of
          this achievement Mr. Philip Beers,
          who has been making a circuity of the
          country on. behalf of the Pedestal fund,
          says that the fund will certainh be
          raised, as the World does not know the
          fail.
          Mr. Beers says that he has found the
          most pronounced generosity anion*
          those of foreign birth. They seem
          more appreciative of liberty than
          do our native born Moreover,
          among some a strange prejudice seems
          to exist
          &quot;Prejudice?&apos; In what particular3*&apos;
          &quot;I have ever found that however
          meritorious a thing may be, thousands
          of people will inevitable be prejudiced
          against it I have spent most of niv
          life on the road and I know the Ameri
          can people &apos;like a book.&apos; In 1879 a
          personal misfortune illustrated this
          prevailing prejudice. I was very ill,
          had suffered for several ears&quot; with
          headache, iickle appetite, dreadful
          backache, cramps, hot head, cold hands
          and teet and a general break down of
          the system. I dragged mj self back to
          New York, seeking the best profession
          al treatment. It so happens that among
          my relatives is a distinguished phys
          cian who upbraided me roundly &quot;for
          preaching so much about rus own case.
          Finnallv, with some spnit, I remarked
          to him:
          &apos;&quot;Sir, you know that much of jour
          professional wisdom is pretense. You
          are controlled by prejudice. You
          cannot reach a case like mine and you
          know it. can you?&quot;&quot;
          &quot;I had him and he finally conceded
          the point, for it was bright&apos;s disease of
          the kidneys which had prostrated me,
          and the schoolmen admit they jjcannot
          enre it. Having cured myself, howev
          er, in 1879, and not having seen a sick
          day since, my relative finally admitted
          that Warner&apos;s safe cure, which accom
          plished this result, was really a wonder
          ful preparation. Had President Butter,
          the Central-Hudson used it, I am
          certain he would be alive to-day, for he
          could not have been in a worse condi
          than I was.&quot;
          &quot;I have found similar prejudices a
          mong all classes concerning even so
          laudable a scheme as the pedestal
          fund.&quot;
          Mr. Beers&quot;s experience and the re
          cent death of President Butter, of the
          Central-Hudson railtoad, of an extreme
          kidney disorder, proves that the phjsi
          cians have no real power over such dis
          eases, and indicates the only course
          one should pursue if, as the late Dr.
          Willard Parker saj-s, headache, sick
          ness of the stomach, dropsical swel
          lings, back ache, dark and offensive
          fluids, prematurely impaired ej esight,
          loss of strength and energj&apos; occur, for
          they unmistakably indicate a fatal re
          sult, if not promptly arrested.
          &quot;Yes, sir-ee, every cent needed for
          the pedestal will be raised. Of course
          it will be a great triumph for theare
          World, but would it not have been an
          eternal disgrace had our people failed
          to provide for this pedestal?&quot;

          From Park Low tbe route was again down Broadway to Courtlandt Btreet and Madi-on Lane,

          quietly at anchor. In a -emi-eircle to the south of Bedloi island were anchor*d the seven
          men-of-war. They were decorated willi flags of all nation-, and had on their gala dress
          for the occasion. The (aland was surrounded all the morning by row boats, yacht-, sailing

          n .liv in front of the -peaker&apos;- -land. M M Bartholdi, De Lesseps, Lafaivre, ami
          Admiral .Lune- were conducted to the stand. After a half hour of waiting a deafening dinof
          whistles, booming cannon, ringing of hell-, and -hout- of people sent the news that
          President Cleveland ami his party were nearing the island. As the cutter Despatch with the
          President on board made Its way through the harbor the yard- of all the men-of war were
          manned, and the pre-i dential salute of twenty-one guns waa given. In a few momenta

          Schofield came to the front of tin- -land and raised hi- hand lo stop the whistling which
          was rasotinding from all Un- steamen in the. harbor, hut the at? tempt to begin Un*
          ceremonial was futile, and fully fifteen minute- longer the noisy deuioiiiatraHon was kept
          up. Dr Slorrs, however, bann his prayer in tie- mid-*; of it all, and Ly thu lime he had
          iiui.-hed the ilin had coa-x-d At 8:80 the whistles again began to screech, and kept it up
          for nearly ten minutes, within which interval the tri? color was hauled from
          Liberty&apos;s face and disclosed much of her bronzed visage a- COUld he -cen through the
          ha/&lt; During the period covering the speeches on shore the boats and ship-of the fleet
          bobbed on thc tide and awaited the end. It came shortly before &quot;i o&apos;clock, when
          thc booming cannon announced the I&apos;llKsIDKN l&apos;s DKI&apos;AKTI&apos;KK. A
          -larboard broadside was fired from all the ships in thc fleet,strong enough,sb an old
          mariner said, &quot; to sour all the milk in creation.&quot; A quarter of an hour later
          th&quot; signal for &quot;down colors&quot; wa- piped on the flagship, and the other ships
          called down their bunting ami ran up their stay I lights. At the same time the navy-vanl
          tug intalpa ran alongside the Despatch and took otf the Prealdeni .&apos;md bia party, the
          Dispatch at thc same time running ?p her anchor light. None of the naval vessels will
          leave their snchoragc to? night. When M. de Lesseps finished hi- ad? dress lhere were loud
          cries for BABTHOLDI, who came forward and Lowed and waved hi- h;it to thc audience-, and
          when thc people Insisted upon a speech from the sculptor,General Schofield abruptly cried
          out. Mr. Bartholdi ha- nothing to say. so there&apos; - no use of talking about it.&quot;
          and announced Senator Fvart Senator Evarta then delivered the PBEBENTATTOB ADDRESS. He
          said Thc scene upon which thia vasl assemblage Ib collei ted displays a transaction in
          human affairs which linda no pr., .&apos;&apos;lent or record in thc past, nor in the long
          future we may feel assured will it ever confront it- counterpart or parallel. The people
          of France contributed from -lender means and of their free will the aggregated wealth
          demanded for so vast an undertaking, all for love of iibert} at home and love of liberty
          abroad, and in hearty homage to ihc friend-hip of these greal republics. A- with the
          French people, BO with our own. thc whole means of the great expenditure of the work h;i-
          come from the free contri? butions of the people themselves, and thus the common?people of
          both nations maj justly point to a Lrrcatcr, a nobler monu? ment in aid of the history and
          progress and welt&apos;ire of thc human race than em? perors, or kin--, or governments
          have ever raised.&quot; In conclusion, Senator Evarta declared the work surrendered to ile
          care and teepine of the i lovernmenl and people of iiu- l nited Sta When Mr. Evarta
          mentioned the name of Bartholdi the audience loudly cheered. Thia wa- mistaken on the part
          of those w ho h;nl charge for the conclusion of the address, when thc unveiling was to
          take place Accordingly the thu wa- with? drawn from the face of the -tatllc. The steamers
          and batteries immediately began a mighty bsJvo of cannonading and whistling, amid which
          Mr. Kv,a rt- help? lessly took hi- scat. Thc -alvo continued fully twenty minnie-. When
          this had ceased, and Gilmore&apos;s hand had played. President Cleveland stepped to the
          front of the -I:iLre and said: &quot;Mr. Chairman and Fellow-Citizens The [..opie of the

          HOW IT WAS. MAIiK ANI PUT IN 1T.ACI&apos;..
          Tho Now York Tribune thus ro
          vlowfl tho history of the great work of
          M. Bartholin which was unveiled ou
          Thursday of last week in tho Now
          York hnrhor.
          Tho history of tho Ilartholdi stntuo
          from iiri&quot;t to last is a checkered ono and
          goes back through nil sorts of delays
          and difficulties lor almost twenty yoaw.
          It was, strangely enough, just at tho
          closo of tho disastrous war with Ger
          many and while tho horrors of tho
          Commune wcro still raging in Paris
          that M. Lahoulnye, tho founder of tho
          French-American Union, first definito
          ly broached his jutriotio project of
          building in this country a joint memo
          rial of the struggles of tho French and
          Americans in tho Uovolution, and sent
          tho young sculptor Bartholdi to thu
          United States to find, if possible, Homo
          suitablo and happy idea. Tho first
          suggestion of tho statue, perhaps, dates
          still further back to a dinner given un
          der thu Empiro by M. Laboulayo at his
          country house, &quot;Glavigny, near Ver
          sailles. St. l.AIIOUt.AYll&apos;s IIOI&apos;KS AND I&apos;ANCIKS.
          It was at that dinner nt Glavigny in
          1885, as Bartholdi himself says, that
          his mind was first turned in tho direc
          tion it was afterward so devotedly and
          enthusiastically to follow. The after
          dinner talk of 31. Iaboulayo&apos;s guests
          had fallen upon gratitudo between na
          tions. Soma ono said that such a thing
          as national gratitudo could not exist.
          Italy no longer felt grateful for tho
          good officers of France in 1859; even
          with the Uuiled States Franco could
          no moro count on tho remembrance of
          the past.
          This 31. Laboulayo stoutly protested
          against. Whatever might bo tho case
          witli Italy, he said, with America
          Francohad still a greater sympathy
          than with any European nation. Amer
          ica&apos;s feeling toward France, too, was
          not ono of simple gratitudo. It was
          based on tho lemenibranco of a, com
          munity of thought and struggles and
          aspirations. And when hearts had
          oneo beaten together something always
          remained behind among nations as
          among individuals. This, ho contin
          ued, was tho basis of tho sentiment
          felt in tho United States toward
          Frauce,a sentiment honorable to Amer
          icans as well as French, and if a mon
          ument weio to bo built in America as
          a memorial of independence it would
          bo most natural to havo it built by a
          united effort, to make it the common
          work of both nations.
          Fivo years after, in tho midst of tho
          war with Germany, Bartholdi found
          himself recurring again to this con
          versation. The war was soon over and
          his uative province, Alsace, shut against
          liim. Ho resolved to travel for a year
          and visit the country in which his in
          terest had been so sharply aroused.
          In a month or two ho found himself
          again at 31. Labotilaye&apos;s house near
          Versailles. With him were 31. Lafa
          yette, Henri 3Iartin, Bomusat, Volow
          ski and DeGaspariu. Tho talk turned
          onco more on tho feeling of America
          for France. 3L Laboulayo took up
          his old viows agaiu and declared that
          without a doubt by 1870 there would
          bo a strong pavdotio and French inovo
          raent in America.
          &apos;Go to seo that country,&quot; he said to
          Bartholdi. &quot;You will study it, and
          bring back your impressions. Pro
          pose to our friends over there to tuako
          a monument in commcn in remem
          brance of tho ancient friendship be
          tween France and tho United Slates.
          Wo will take up a subscription in
          France. If yon find a happy idea, wo
          aro convinced that it will bo successful
          on both continents, and wo shall do a
          work which will have a far-icaching
          moral effect.
          Bartholdi tells all this in his modest
          little sketch of the work of tho French
          Committee. And in thepo two convei-
          satinns at 31. Labotilaye&apos;s the germ of
          tho French-American Union&apos;s project
          may bo found.

          Tho sculptor thought over noma
          plans for the proposed monument on
          tho way out, but only hazily. Suddon
          lv, ono beautiful sprinc morning,
          steaming up through tho Narrows into
          New x oik my, tho moment ot inspi

          fancy tho maiestio figure of Liberty
          towering with her torch over tho bas
          tions of old Fort Wood, lighting thu
          crowded harbor, with its tributary riv
          ers aud tho vast, blackhued cities on
          their borders, tho very imago of a
          teeming, populous miniature world.

          ticularly and in Philadelphia to whom
          31. Laboulayo had given him loiters of
          introduction, ho soon disoovercd that
          ho could look for support in the United
          States that, as ho says, the draft
          drawn by tho French Committeo on
          American sentiment would not ho pro
          tested. M. Laboulayo had had somo
          correspondence already with John Jay
          and others respecting tho monument;
          hut though tho interest which Barthol
          di mentions was no doubt arouset&apos;, no
          formal nction was taken until tho
          soulptor&apos;s second vis&apos;r, here,

          Going back to France, Bartholdi run
          over his impressions lo 31, Laboulayo
          and his friends, and laid beforo them
          tho plan for a stntuo iu Now York
          harbor. Thoy udoptvd it with enthusi
          asm, A committee was organized tin
          der tho name of tho Fronch-Ainerican
          Union, and Bartholdi set to work to
          mako his first models. Tho full plan
          of tho Union was made public at tho
          and of 1871, and subscription lists
          wp0 soon peculating throughout
          Kiaiice. A good ileal of money oamo
          in at onco mid moro was promised.
          Tho actual moulding of tho hugo
          cast began in 1875, Tho birth of tho
          stntuo was celebrated on November Oth
          of that year by a dinner nt tho Hotel
          du Louvre, at which tint Aaicrioan
          Minister, 3Ir. Washbunu&apos;, and all tho
          prominent memhets of tho French
          Amerioan Union wcro present. Tho
          ritrht liund of tho goddess was struck
          off in its colossal proportions nnd Bent
          to the Centennial Exhibition at Phila
          delphia iu 1870.
          5, 1886.
          Bartholdi himself camo over in that
          year ns one of tho French jury for tho
          eihihitlon. Tho unveiling of his stat-
          no oi littayette, which was oruorcd by
          tho Fronoh Government as a gift to
          tho city of Now York In acknowledg
          ment of the rolief sent to Paris after
          tho siege, nnd which now stands in
          Union Square, gavo him an opportuni
          ty to push matters among ins Now
          York friends.
          A call for a meeting nt tho Century
          Club was issued by William 31. Ev
          arts, John Jay, W. II. Wickham, S. D.
          Babcoek, William II. Appleton and
          Kiohard Butler. There tho plau of
          tho French committeo was talked over
          with Bartholdi aud Hocharabcau and
          an American committee was organized.
          .Mr. Evarte was its chairman nnd Rich
          ard Butler its secretary. Sub-committees
          wero appointed and weekly meet
          ings wcro held for a tnno. Tho ques
          tion of procuring legislation from Con
          gress was tho most important.
          After somo drawbacks and delnys, a
          joint resolution was introduced accept
          ing tho statue and setting apart n silo
          on either Governor&apos;s or Bedlow&apos;s Is
          land for tho statue, and on February
          22, 1877, it passed both Houses. Gen
          eral W. T. Sherman was sent on to do
          cide between thu two, and wisely con
          firmed Bartholdi&apos;s choice. Fort Wood
          was given up as a military post and
          turned over to the uso of the Ameri
          can committee.
          TAnnv mtowTii ov the statuk.
          Bartholdi went back to Franco in
          tho fall of 187G Tho political crisis
          that camo toward tho end of 31ac3Ia
          hon&apos;s Presidency had bad a disastrous
          effect on tho affairs of the French
          American Union. Subscriptions had
          almost ceased to come in nnd word was
          sent to tho American committeo that
          tho work on the foundation and pedes
          tal of tho statue bad better bo post
          poned for a year or two. It was not
          until 1879 that money enough was
          raised in Frauco to pay tho baro ex
          penses of the work on tho statue.
          Iu 1878, however, Bartholdi, san
          guine nnd undaunted as ever, executed
          tho head for tho Paris Exposition.
          The other parts followed at intervals,
          and by July, 1880, tho French com
          mittee saw its way clear to report sub
          stantial progress to tho American com
          mittee aud to fix a probable date for
          tho completion of tho statue. On Oc
          tober 24, 1881, tho anniversary of the
          surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown
          all the pieces of tho framework and of
          tho baso were put in place, and Levi
          P. 3Iorton, then United States Minister
          to France, was invited to drive tho riv
          et of tho first piece which was to bo
          mounted. Tho statue was nearly fin
          ished in 1883, but tho work on the pe
          destal here was so backward that it
          was decided to leave tho completed
          goddess on exhibition for awbilo iu
          Paris.
          Finally, on July 4,lS84,Count Ferdi
          nand do Lessops, who had succeeded
          31. Laboulayo as President of tho
          French Committee, turned the statuo
          over iorracrlly to tho Unitod States
          through 3Ir, 3Iorton. It stood six
          months longer waiting for tho comple
          tion of tho pedestal. It seemed for a
          tlmo that it would havo to wait torov
          cr, and tho work of taking it down was
          beguu in January, 1883, with many
          misgivings. Tho pieces wero packed
          carefully in 210 cases and stowed on
          board tho French man-of-war Isero at
          Rouen. Tho statuo was insured for
          about half its value.
          Tho Isero had an extremely rough
          voyago nnd had to put back onco to
          Rouen to escape a storm. Outside tho
          harbor of New York sho was met by
          the French North Atlantic Squadron,
          under Admiral La Combe, and escort
          ed into tho bay with flying colors.
          The Isero reached Now York iu June,
          188.). Tho pieces of tho statue wero
          lightered over to Bedlow&apos;s Island and
          wero stored thero until 3Iay last, when
          the work ot setting up tho great cop
          per goddess for the last time was begun.
          Till! AMERICAN COMMITTEE&apos;S TKIAI.S.
          Tho American committee could do
          nothing, of Course, after obtaining tho
          grant of a sito from Congress, but wait
          for tho signal from 31. Bartholdi and
          his friends to break ground for tho
          statue&apos;s pedestal. In 1882 somo pre
          liminary steps wero taken. A publio
          meeting was held in tho Academy of
          3Iusio on November 2i? of that year,
          and tho taking of subsciiptions was
          pushed vigorously.
          Iho Mow York Legislature passed a
          bill appropriating $.&quot;0,000 for tho work
          on tho pedestal. But Governor Clove
          land vetoed it, to tho great disgust
          of tho managers of tho Pedestal Fund,
          as unconstitutional. A still greater
          disappointment camo with tho winter
          ot lH84.ii. A bill appropriating SI 00-
          000 was introduced during tho short
          session of Congress, nnd failed through
          the neglect of tho Committeo on Ap
          propriations to insert tho item in their
          mat report.
          Work on tho foundation inside tho
          old fort was begun in tho spring of
          1883, an. I the loundnttou itself was
          finished hetoro tho end of that year.
          In tho spring of 1881 tho corner-stone
          of tho pedestal was laid, aud a fow
          tiers of granite wero nddod now nnd
          then from inonlh to month. Tho first
          bit of enthusiasm was over, and tho
          subscription list hung fire. Statuettes
          and photographs wero slruok off by
          tho committeo and offered for sale, but
          tho returns grow smaller nnd smaller.
          One hundred aud sovo&apos;nty-fivo thous
          and dollars had been raised by tho
          summer of 188(, and tho committee&apos;s
          persuasive powers wero apparently ex
          hausted, Its run of bni luck could
          not ho broken.
          In 3Iarch, 1885, when tho statuo was
          almost ready for shipmeut, and tho
          American committee, in a state of
          thickening despair, tho Now York
          World unexpectedly undertook to
          raiso tho $100,000 Btill needed, and
          opened a subscription list of its own
          for that purpose. By Julv a total of
          S102, 000.30 was turned into tho Po-
          destal Fund. This tided tho commit
          teo over tho fall and winter of 1885,
          nun sorvoit, indeed, to hnUh tho mas
          sivo pedestal in April, 18S0.
          I ho iron framework nnd braces lor
          tho support of tho stntuo wero put up
          in may ami June, and on July l&apos;.&apos;th
          tho work on tho copper plating itself
          was begun, 3Inny of tho huge pieoos
          boxed up so long, shaken about in so
          many handlings nnd exposed to a great
          variety ot temperatures, had flattened
          out of their original shape. There
          was a great deal of delay from tltno to
          uniu in reiuriuuig tiiciu, anil uio sum

          For tho last month or moro almost
          dally nolo has been mado of tho slow
          progress of riveting tho vast copper
          shout hi r together and tho gradual
          softening of tho heavy lines and sur
          faces which looked so coarso and vague
          aground, to tho easy, graceful, airy
          symmetry of tho splendid figure as it
          now stands. Tho statuo was practi
          cally finished on October 1G. From
          that day, at least, tho Amoricnn com
          mittee will always dato its first mo
          mcnt of relief.
          THE SITE AND TUB POUNIIATION.
          BjrthoHi himself choso Bedlow&apos;s Is.
          land fifteen years ago for tho sito of
          his great monument. No spot, in fact,
          could havo been n happier ono for tho
          purpose. From tho shores of the Bay
          tho level islet looks like tho mere natu
          ral baso of the vast statuo and its solid-faced
          pedestal.
          Cut away from any rival objects
          largo or small, dwarfed or dwaifitiir.
          tho colossal figure stands clearly against
          the freo back-ground of water, land
          and sky, bletidiug with them easily nnd
          simply, liko an imago drawn, as tho
          goddtss is, on their own scale. And
          if tho great bronzo figure Ills, liko ono
          of its own rivetB in tho copper sheath,
          into the surroundings of sea and sky,
          tho granite pedestal finds aready-mado
          support to tho double star-shaped inner
          walls of old Fort Wood
          Tho base of tho pedestal is almost
          hidden from the outside behind them,
          and when tho old parado ground is
          filled in, and tho sodded tcrraco slopes
          gently downward from the crown of
          tho foundation over them to the sea
          wall below, thoir tops will mako an
          easy break halt-way whero Iho stair
          cases will broaden out into spacious
          platforms, and benches will bo ranged
          for loiterers in tho pleasant weather.
          Tho outworks of tho fort have disap
          peared i so have tho powder-houses
          and tho sally-ports. Tho baBtions
          themselves will soon bo buried in tho
          dirt. Only the small sea battery with
          its guns freshly polished for display,
          net use, will be left to remind one in a
          year or two that Bedlow&apos;s Island was
          once a Govortiment post.
          The bulk of tho pedestal&apos;s founda
          tion will, of course, be out of sight
          when the landscape gardener has fin
          ished his work ou the approaches to
          tho statue. It starts, in fact, beneath
          the old parado ground, at thirteen feet
          above tho mean low water mark. In
          shape it is something liko a truncated
          pyramid, with a gentle slope.
          It does not rise, however, with a
          continuous wall, but with a series of

          greav layers oi concrete, each one a
          trifle smaller than the one it rests up
          on. Tho top reaches up above tho fort
          walls fifty-two feet ten inchos from tho
          baso. There is no break to the very
          top. The whole thing is a vast mass
          of concrete and rock, which measures
          on its upper face about sixty-fivo feet
          square.
          A WELL 11UILT PEDESTAL.
          Tho pedestal proper at its baso is
          sixty-two feet square, and begins at an
          elevation above tide-water or sixty-fivo
          feet. In the middle of each face, just
          on a leval with the proposed terrace,
          is doorway, fivo feet wido and thir
          teen feet high. On each-side of every
          door is a projecting disk of stone on
          which tho arms of the United States
          and of Franco will bo cut in lelief.
          Abovu the doors is a broad band of
          stono running around tho pedestal and
          broken into forty smooth faced medal
          lions, ten on each Bide, on which the
          coats-of-arms of tho various States will
          probably bo placed. Still higher than
          tho medallions aro four largo nanols.
          twenty-threo feet and six inches long
          and fivo feet and three inches from top
          to bottom. Theso will also bo covered
          with appropriate inscriptions and de
          signs.
          Whero tho walls io:n again thero s
          a jutting frieze of plain L-ranite, crown
          ed with a low open balcony on which
          lour aooi&apos;s open again Irom the shaft
          within. Hero tho third section begins.
          Tho walls contract several feet, though
          tho balcony rail breaks tho sharpness
          cf tho effect from below. It is but a
          few tiers now to the top of tho pedes
          tal, hid from viow by tho rich drapery
          of the goddess&apos;s tunic. Tho topmost
          platform is thirty-nino feet and four
          and threo eighths inches squaro and
          io leoi nuovo low-water m,rk,
          Tho pedestal is in its way a most
          graceful and modest structure. It, is
          neither monotonous or heavy, and has
          been raado to look smaller than it
          really is. Tho goddess, in fact gains
          n point ot elevation by this suppress-
          ion, and towers over everything else,
          but tho effect is in no wav forced or
          stilt-like. Tho soft gray shado of tl o
          pedestal blonds well with tho reddish
          brown of the copper, nnd the whiteness
          of tho rough quoins shows far aoross
          tho water in the slanting rays of tho
          early morning or lato afternoon sun

          was tho chief engineer of tho work.
          Richard 31. Hunt tho arceitect, and
          David II. King, Jr., tho builder. Tho
          pedestal cost in all about $250,000.
          COLOSSAL SIZE OF TUP. KIODKE.
          Tho Goddess of Libertv is tho larg
          est work of its kind that has over been
          completed. Tho legendary Colossus of
          lvhodcs could not possibly havo had
          tho shapo of bigness attributed to it.
          Tho colossal statuo ot Arnuntus, iu Ba
          varia, is about ninety-four feet in
          height that of St. Charles Borromco,
          on tho shores of Lake 3Iaggiore, sixty

          Nr.w York, Oct. 28. The rain, which
          fell almost continuously for thirty-six
          hours, did not ce.ie until about daylight
          this morning. The sky did not clear,
          however, ami the thonautls of anxious
          sightseers who began to pour Into the
          streets at an early hour met. a I;imp, fos
          gy atmosphere, which threatened a re
          newal of rain at any moment.
          The storm greatly Interfered with
          the work on Bedloe&apos;s Island yesterday,
          but ns little t.t.s left to&quot; do. it
          did not mailer very much whether it
          I rained or not. The woikmen tore down
          the old, narrow steps thai led up the em
          j banknient ami replaced tnem with :i
          wilier and more substantial stairwav.
          j They also laid a broad wooden walk lead
          ing to tnc ;:rouuu entrance to the front
          of the fort. The plat
          form that has stood
          in one ot the north
          western angles of the
          Inclosurewas remov
          ed and the nlatfurm
          for the speakers
          made ready for their
          reception. A hand
          some Mik French flair
          will no placed over
          the face of the statue.
          At a word from Pres

          will be drawn, iinvcil-
          tiik f.ici:. ins the head of the
          poiMcss.
          Between 8 and 9 o&apos;clock all thorough
          fares showed signs of unusual activity.
          All trains were ciowded to their utmost
          capacity wilh people hurrying to advanta
          geous noints to vie w the gi and procession.
          Iu the vicinity of Filth avenue and
          Filty-.&apos;oventh .-treet, the point at whicn
          the procession wns to form, all was bustle
          and commotion as eailv as eight o&apos;clock.
          Civic and military companies nriived
          faster than they could be assigned to their
          proper piaces.
          At a lew minutes past ten o&apos;clock the
          head of the column began to move down
          Fifth avenue, led by the Fifth United
          States Artlllcrv and .Military Band. Then
          followid the United StatesXaval brigade,
          Uniietl Males Army brigade. Second reg
          iment Now Jersey National Guard and a
          di&apos;tachment of Ma-aciiiisctts volunteer
          militia. These composed the first divi
          sion. The second division was loci by Gil
          niore&apos;s famous baud. Then followed the
          Fiist Brigade, X. G. S. N. Y., acting as
          escort to the French column. The
          Fiench column contained ttie Socie&apos;.e
          Colmarienne; Union .Wsacicnuc; Socielc
          Alsiice-I.oiaiue; Marcli Gras Association;

          inaire Cosmopolite; L&apos; Helvetieiiiie; L&apos;
          Alliance and L&apos; Union Fraternellc.
          Then came another line band of music,
          which was followed by nearly a dozen
          moie Fiench societies. Behind the
          Frenchmen came the United Stale
          Judges and other high officials of tin:
          United Slates in carriages, and Governors
          ot Mates and Territoiics and other high
          dignitaries, also in carriages, who brought
          up the rear ot the second division.
          The third division was headed by
          Sheriff Grant as marshal, and was com
          prised of mayors of cities; a battalion
          of Philadelphia police; Brooklyn police:
          veterans ol the war of 1812; veterans of
          the .Mexican war, and the military order
          of the Loyal Legion.
          The fourth, fifth and sixth divisions
          were composed of military organizations.
          Then came the educational division: then
          mote military; Washington&apos;s carriage,
          drawn by nine lioies, escorted by the
          Continental Guard of Washington, and
          the old Washington Continental Guard,
          mounted. Firemen, Knights of Pythias
          and other organization&apos;s all helped to
          make up the other four divisions.
          As this brilliant column passed down
          Fifth avenue it was received by the enor
          mous crowds, which flanked it ou either
          tide with mighty cheers
          As the procession approached the re
          viewing stand at Madison Square, where
          President Cleveland and members of Ids
          Cab net were in waiting, a slight drizzle
          cf rain bi-gan falling, not enough, how
          ever, to disturb the crowd or spoil the
          spectacle.
          After passing through Martion Square
          the colnmn moved on down Fifth Avenue
          to Washington Square, where it turned
          into Broadway, thence dewu Broadway

          the triumphal arch in front of the M&apos;orM
          otllce, nnd back into Broadway. This de
          tour was more In order to pay a compli
          ment to the enterprise of the World, in
          raising the sum necessary for ralslug
          Bartholdi&apos;s great work.
          From Park Bow the route was again
          down Broadway to Courtlandt street and
          Maiden Lane, where most of the mili
          tary, turning to right or left, made their
          way to the river.
          The head of the procession reached the
          City Hall at noon. At the same time,
          whenever the iunIc of the bands ceased,
          the chimes of Trinity Church could be
          heard playing National airs of France
          and America.
          President Cleveland, accompanied by
          Secretary Bayard, drove to the reviewing
          stand at Madison square. He was fol
          lowed by Secretaries Whitney, Vilas and
          Lamar aud Colonel Lamout.
          Alter leaving Broadway at Cortlandt
          street and Maiden Lane, nearly all the
          military and civic companies made their
          way homeward.
          At this hour hoar (1:15 p. m.), the
          procession is still wending its way past
          the United Press office, 187 Broadway,
          having been over an hour in progress.
          All the vessels in North river are gaily
          decorated with flags, tho Great Atlantic
          liners being particularly noticeable as
          they lay at their docks, one mass ot color
          aloft.
          The naval parade, which forms another
          marked feature of the day, was set for
          one o&apos;clock. The sound of the prepa
          tatory gun, which should have been fired
          at 12:45 p. m., was not heard until one
          o&apos;clock, and there was considerable delay
          In getting the vessels which were to take
          part into line. Twenty minutes later the
          signal for the start was given, and tho
          vessels moved slowlv in double line from
          Forty-fifth street down North river, past
          a fleet of war vessels, toward Liberty
          Island. This procession was in charge
          of Lieutenant-Commander liich, and con
          sisted of two divisions. The first division
          was headed by the United Stales coast
          survey steamer Gciluuy, and consisted of
          all the larger vesels. The second divi
          sions consisted of tugs and miscellane
          ous crall of all descriptions. The ves
          sels presented a oeautiful sight as thev
          steamed down the Hudson. On i caching
          Liberty Island, they passed astern of the
          lii-m-ul-war anchored below the island
          then ill) between them and the island, till

          ognized by the mass, who had seen his
          portrait on programmes and in the il
          lustrated papers, a shout went up Irom
          those neatest the stand. The cry of
          &quot;Bartholdi&quot; was then caught np by both
          the reviewing Mid grand stands. The
          crowds on tin: avenue cuibings up and

          the people in the park and side

          with a i oar of cheering that must have
          gladdened the heart ol the Alsatian, who
          bowed his acknowledgments. Ami then,
          in carriages driven to the rear of the
          stand, came Mr. Cleveland and his party.
          Instantly lie was recognized, and again
          the crowds shook the welkin with their
          shouts, and from the housetops and win
          dows of hotels came shouts and sounds
          of clapping hands to swell Hie sound
          that like a wave broke over the park and
          flowed down tbc streets and along the
          avenue, where, in the misty distance, t lie
          trappings mid pomp of the head of the
          column was seen moving. The Signal
          Service operator at the Twenty-eighth

          tiic throngs by a waving flag, and the
          pressure Increased toward the avenue
          and the people became packed more

          on the ocexsion of the unveiling of the
          great statue led Mr. Clews and the other
          gentlemen named to agree to furnish the

          given by James Pain, of Manhattan Bench,
          under the direction of the New York
          IPorid. When Mr. Pain was spoken to
          in regard to the matter he generously of
          fered to double whatever sum was raised
          by the patriotic friends of the statue and
          give a programme that would folly real
          ize their expectations. The ground had
          been gone over by an agent of Mr. Pain,
          nnd no trouble or expense was spared to
          make the displays the grandest
          ever witnessed In this country. The vast
          materials for the fireworks had been spe
          cially prepared for this occasion by Mr.
          Pain, and several new effects In pyro
          technics were introduced. The displays
          were begun with the lighting of the great
          torch for the first tinicl and were given
          simultaneoualy on Liberty and Govern
          or&apos;s islands, including some sixty sepa
          rate pyrotechnic pieces. With slight va
          riations the fireworks were the same on
          Liberty island and in front of old Castle
          William, on Governor&apos;s Island, and
          were set off by maroon signals from the
          statue. The displays were largely
          aerial and were vis
          ible from all parts of
          the harbor, although
          the best positions
          were the Battery and

          The famous statue, by Bartholdi, of
          &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot; was
          received at New York, June 211, 1885.
          The Fiencli vessel Isere, wttli the statue
          on board, was escorted up the b-iy to
          Bcdloe&apos;s Island by a number of United
          States men-of-war and other vessels. The
          statue stands on Bcdloe&apos;s Island here
          after to be known as Liberty Island. At
          tlie entrance to New York haibor,
          Bartholdi, it is said, conceived the idea
          of rearing a colossal statue to symbolize
          America&apos;s message of liberty to the world
          whiie sailing up Aew lork bay on his
          vi-it to this country in 1871, with heart
          depressed at the itiin and wretchedness
          in his native land after her defeat bv Ger
          many. On his return to France he sug
          gested to his friends his idea of such
          a statue to be presented by the
          French nation to the United States.
          The idea was received with great favor,
          and so rapidly did subscriptions come
          iu that in 187(1 the sculptor began work
          upon his great statue. M. Bartholdi
          supervised every step of the work
          which was not only a
          labor of many years,
          but one lull of di!li
          culty and detail The
          first &quot;steps toward its
          construction were
          made iu 1874, when
          the French-American
          union was establish
          ed, a banquet given
          and an appeal made to
          the people of France.
          In 1870 the sculptor
          began actual work.
          First the artist made
          his model in clay,
          and when this was
          approved a plaster
          statue was made; in
          dimensions it was
          one-sixteenth thesize
          THE TORCH.
          of the intended statue. Another plaster
          statue four times as large as the first, and
          a third one, of the full dimensions ol the
          finished work were made. The last
          modci hnd to be made iu sections, and a
          wooden frame-work was constructed on
          which the plaster was spread. When
          these sections were completed, wooden
          models were used, exact copies of the
          plaster In size and modeling. These
          were carcfnlly cut out by hand, and in
          them were shaped the hammered brass
          work which forms the outside of the
          statue. Eighty-eight tons of brass were
          used in the structure, and the entire
          weight of the statue is 450,000 pounds.
          In 187G M. Bartholdi, with the extended
          right arm of the statue the first part
          that was completed came to America
          and placed the arm and torch iu
          the Centennial Exhioition at Phila
          delphia, whence it was subscqnently
          removed to Madison Square, New
          York. In February, 1877, Congress set
          apart Liberty Island lor the statue,
          and a committee was chosen with
          William M. Evarts at its head. The
          face and head of the statue was com
          pleted in 1878, when it was placed in the
          FrcuchExposition.andouJuly 7, 1880, the
          great figure was com
          pleted in Paris, where
          it was temporarily
          put together the fol

          ed States Minister
          and a gathering of
          prominent French
          people. This statue
          is a free gift of re
          spect and good will
